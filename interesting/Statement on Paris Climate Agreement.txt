Statement on Paris Climate Agreement
October 5, 2016|Speaker Ryan Press Office
WASHINGTON—House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) issued the following statement on the Paris climate agreement set to go into effect next month:

“The Paris climate deal would be disastrous for the American economy. It carelessly throws away the great gains that the United States has made over the past decade in energy development. The abundant, low-cost energy that we have unlocked will now be shut in the ground, eliminating the economic growth and jobs that come with development. The result will be higher energy costs for Americans—which will be especially painful for the poorest among us. Furthermore, President Obama has once again acted unlawfully by signing an international treaty without Senate ratification, as required by the Constitution.”
