Do you think the populist wave that lifted both will spread further? </p><p data-line-id="0058f6ade8bf466d9d3abf506c15b8dc"><strong>JS: I think societies everywhere are very divided. Whether it’s 51-49 or 49-51, we are not seeing landslide wins for populism, but rather a reflection of deep social divisions. And, yes, I think we’re going to see more of this, because there are so many anxieties that we don’t seem able to overcome.</strong></p><div class="highlighted-container-embedded highlighted-standard" style="background-color: ">

</div><p data-line-id="0ad66ebb3f3d496db7a481a77ec22c41"><strong>Even the foundations of foreign policy are giving way. The Middle East crises are the result of America’s failure and fading global power, which are part of the social anguish many voters feel. Likewise, Brexit reflects a collapse in belief in the postwar order in Western Europe, which was forged during the Cold War but has now basically disintegrated.</strong><strong></strong></p><p data-line-id="de0c6df43e724a2b99bdf519ca528575"><strong>SS:</strong> You attribute populism to four factors: rising nationalism, the weakening of American foreign policy, the crisis of the center left, and the refugee crisis. Yet you’re an economist. So what about economics? </p><p data-line-id="4f6310e292184438a19c05f4a80e8121"><strong>JS: Of all of the factors at play in today’s political upheavals, I don’t think economics is the main one. That’s illustrated by one important data point: Scandinavia. All of the Scandinavian countries, and their neighbors in northern Europe, have right-wing populist parties, with some approaching power. And yet you can’t do better than these countries in terms of living standards, social justice, and opportunity. So, if northern European countries, including the star performers of Scandinavia, are facing a populist backlash, it is hard to blame economic causes.</strong></p><p data-line-id="b642382a07874f06bf36922f9e26c684"><strong>Even the Netherlands – affluent, peaceful, prosperous, educated – is now confronting a right-wing populist surge. Yes, massive inequality, erosion of public services, and political corruption are in some sense part of the local context in the United States; yet in northern Europe, these factors are largely absent.</strong><strong></strong></p><p data-line-id="2567e276df8643d0bddad142736d551a"><strong>For me, the most pertinent fact is that populist Scandinavians are calling for a social-democratic order, but one for Danes or Swedes or Norwegians alone. They like their society; they just don’t want newcomers. So, it’s explicitly anti-migrant – essentially a demographic and cultural reflex.</strong><strong></strong></p><p data-line-id="ac397550082841d49591dbe7640114d9"><strong>SS:</strong> Maybe their expectations are higher? </p><p data-line-id="db599603a2cf41e8a80ed27e6ee82f76"><strong>JS: No, looking from the Netherlands and to the north, I think people really like their social order – again, I don’t think we know how to make economies work better than those countries do. What many of their people apparently don’t like is Muslims living in their country. They don’t want mosques in their neighborhoods. That’s not true of everybody, of course, but that’s what the backlash reflects. And, of course, the terrible recent mosque attack in Quebec City shows the same phenomenon in another mostly tolerant society on the other side of the Atlantic.</strong></p><p data-line-id="0d3fd5e906ba4883b78ea89935684e0a"><strong>Mainstream politicians like German Chancellor Angela Merkel say: We’re rich, let’s be generous. But it doesn’t resonate politically, because it doesn’t answer people’s fundamental questions: What do you mean by “generous”? How many millions of people will be allowed to enter? Is there any limit or is the generosity open ended? Are we to eliminate national borders altogether to allow in whoever wants to come?</strong><strong></strong></p><p data-line-id="3cb99decb6234bf9ac986a31daf25308"><strong>In my view, a borderless world is plainly unrealistic. If people were told that they could move, no questions asked, probably a billion would shift around the planet within five years, with many coming to Europe or the US. No society would tolerate even a fraction of that flow. Any politician who says, “Let’s be generous,” without saying, “We’re not going to throw the doors wide open,” will lose. So, I think that’s where the left is tongue-tied, because it sounds chauvinistic to say we need a limit on migration. It would be better to say, “We must help the refugees; they are fleeing for their lives. But, yes, we must also step up efforts to end the Syrian war, and thereby enable the refugees to return to their homeland once the fires are put out.”</strong><strong></strong></p><h2 data-line-id="5f030fc225f54ca2a26d9a2ebad84813">Hard Demographic Truths </h2><p data-line-id="5faed572e3cc462d9ee07ead029f38a7"><strong>SS:</strong> Many argue that immigrants are an economic boon, and that we Europeans need them because of our aging societies. </p><p data-line-id="47176a3cc96f49a88e35ffbb0f3a954b"><strong>JS: I think there are several problems with that argument. One is that almost any major economic event like a large-scale migration has far-reaching distributional consequences. So, when people say that we’ll be better off, who’s “we”? Many lower-skilled, working-class, less-educated people certainly would <i>not</i> be made better off by open immigration. That’s not an illusion, just basic economics. New York City’s low-wage, low-cost service sector benefits me, a professional with a good income and economic security. But why should anyone employed in that sector and just trying to hold on – worried about paying the rent, keeping the utilities turned on, finding affordable childcare – welcome direct competition from migrants. They won’t. And as migrants do arrive, the fiscal system must ensure that the working class doesn’t bear the brunt of the adjustment.</strong></p><p data-line-id="9ab67048353d4129961f74e173ab90bb"><strong>SS:</strong> Yet they will come. Around Europe and the West, there are at least a billion hungry people. They will come. We’re deluding ourselves if we think we can stick to borders. </p><p data-line-id="e81b21c1985e4d6dbb66825b1549f1d9"><strong>JS: I don’t believe it’s that simple. I think the trafficked or undocumented migrants coming into the US are able to come and stay mostly because a lot of people in the US make a lot of money employing them at very low wages. There are reportedly 11 million undocumented Mexican workers in the US. Why do people hire them? Those who make the choice don’t care about the consequences for anyone else. That’s the arrogance of the professional or business class in the US. They don’t think about the consequences for America’s lesser-skilled workers, who compete with the migrants. If such migrants do come, the tax-and-benefit system of the federal government and the states should help those who have been hit.</strong></p><p data-line-id="0d692a4fbf6b411796025300c28a9eb5"><strong>SS:</strong> But is it stoppable? </p><p data-line-id="694d3c63448743f8b5b1ff552e422067"><strong>JS: Yes, borders can and should be policed. Of course, refugees fleeing for their lives must be helped. That’s not only basic human decency; it’s also international law. But refugees and economic migrants are two different matters. No rich country is under the obligation to open its doors to all of the economic migrants that would come. That is simply impossible. And please note that regulating borders is a different question from the mass deportation of the millions of people who are already in the US for years without legal permission. A mass deportation would be hugely painful and disruptive to millions of lives.</strong><br></p><p data-line-id="c563b49e65c64f5b80bb9a10c84cec98"><strong>As for refugees, the most important thing to do is to stop the cruel, useless, and deeply misguided wars that have triggered the mass movements of refugees. The US bears the main responsibility for the recent wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria that have been the main cause of the mass refugee movements of recent years. Those were wars of choice (mainly of attempted regime change) and should never have occurred. Yet now the US shirks all responsibility for even a single refugee. Trump’s ban on refugees is disgusting and dangerous.</strong><br></p><p data-line-id="da95f40da0e2437cbd43bda07b4592ea"><strong>Yet when we consider economic migrants, it’s essential to note the long-term, slow-moving demographic aspect to what has happened to Europe and to the US. In 1950, Europe had more people than all of Africa and the Middle East combined. Today, it’s completely the reverse: the European Union has 500 million people, while Sub-Saharan Africa has a billion, the Middle East has hundreds of millions of people, and North Africa probably has 150 million or more.</strong><strong></strong></p><p data-line-id="93a002e5826b4bea9e9ce318f9f9a50e"><strong>Likewise, if you look at the US population compared to the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central America, we have a similar, if less dramatic shift over a 75-year period. So, with regard to economic migration, what we’re observing in the West is fundamentally a demographic phenomenon. For some people, the changing racial, ethnic, religious, and linguistic character of our societies is fine; for others, it’s profoundly unsettling. The divide is roughly half and half.</strong><strong></strong></p><p data-line-id="8e4850243bbe4f9fb59e1808c3c389b3">SS: You find this trend troubling as well. </p><p data-line-id="8d7b46bed14a412487867b0be936372b"><strong>JS: Africa’s demographic trajectory is deeply worrisome because it is built on an extremely high fertility rate that will hinder its own sustainable development. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the average fertility rate remains more than five children per woman, and the resulting population trajectory is roughly a quadrupling of the continent’s population by the end of this century. That means about four billion people in Sub-Saharan Africa, compared to a European population that might be around 500 million at the end of the century. One can only imagine what kind of pressures – perhaps completely irresistible – this would generate. And there’s almost no public discussion about it, because you can see how incredibly sensitive this topic is. It can be misconstrued as racist to talk about it, so the left doesn’t, religious groups won’t, and politicians – facing an issue that will ripen only long after they’re out of power – steer clear. Yet the first point is that Africa’s own economic, social, and environmental health depend on achieving a rapid and voluntary reduction of fertility rates, mainly by enabling Africa’s girls and boys to remain in school.</strong></p><p data-line-id="74700252004d4a569012948d7ef471b3"><strong>SS:</strong> So, because this is extremely sensitive politically, we’re trapped? </p><p data-line-id="34822bfae3b54ce9830c92f2abc2bc99"><strong>JS: There are two points. One is to recognize that these demographic changes are in nobody’s interest, and that they really should be a matter of direct policy attention. I say that at the risk of serious misunderstanding. But the bottom line is that Africa will never achieve successful development if it reaches four billion people at the end of this century. That trajectory would lead to unbearable environmental stress, hunger, war, water depletion, and destruction of remaining biodiversity. It would be a disaster first and foremost for Africa.</strong></p><p data-line-id="dc268b472bd54a12b75790bfa38c805d"><strong>But it’s possible to promote a rapid demographic change by simple and utterly decent means. Most important, helping to keep girls in school through secondary school, thereby promoting an education revolution, would reduce the fertility rate within a generation – probably to below three, and possibly to below two, and all in a wholly voluntary manner. I raise this point all the time with African and European leaders, but there’s a great difficulty and reluctance to grapple now with a reality that’s 20 or 40 or 60 years ahead.</strong><strong></strong></p><p data-line-id="020d9587ae2b41b0b6b76bf0126f238e"><strong>SS:</strong> And the second point? </p><p data-line-id="20e984b89bc944f4b61341aecd76f63c"><strong>JS: Trump’s announcement that he would construct a wall on the Mexican border horrified right-thinking Americans. It sounds so vulgar, like building the Berlin Wall. But to half the country, it made sense. Don’t countries have borders, and don’t you police borders? And that’s where I return to my critique of the center left. Would a fence or a wall work? To a large extent, yes, it would, actually. But the left doesn’t have a language that acknowledges the need for borders and the need to police them. I’m not in favor of a wall, <i>per se</i>, but I am in favor of regulated borders, not an open door to unregulated migration. All high-income countries need borders. Borders do not mean closed doors or bans (like Trump’s), least of all religiously based bans, which are deeply offensive and self-defeating. But borders do mean enforcement of limits to migration.</strong></p><p data-line-id="e4a79dacc6b447e8b03e94af4728f716"><strong>SS:</strong> And the left should say that? We need borders? </p><p data-line-id="683d637d89704691bee350f40b31193d"><strong>JS: Of course. And we should police them. We should have migration, because diversity is good; but we should not have open doors, because we can’t afford it, and we don’t want it. I think the most basic idea that needs to be worked out is managed migration, whereby people arrive legally at a certain rate that is proportionate to the country’s size and pace of demographic change.</strong></p><p data-line-id="d36b12fcb33c4379acd680593c934905"><strong>SS:</strong> So who and how many should be welcome? Should the poorest receive priority, or should it be the best educated, the youngest, refugees? Perhaps those who are most culturally similar? </p><p data-line-id="b91fe8a8d46f42f990fc33b2cca49a4f"><strong>JS: The first distinction is refugees and non-refugees. We have international law on refugees, based on the principle of non-refoulement: you can’t return refugees to a place where they are likely to be persecuted. A refugee is someone who is fleeing persecution, and the first thing you want to do to resolve a refugee crisis is to stop the underlying cause. Europe has had a long debate over the last three years about Syrian refugees, but it has had no debate at all about the Syrian war, because Europe has no foreign policy and no capacity to address foreign-policy issues collectively.</strong></p><h2 data-line-id="c4eeba02f37145dba2b0e0ee3bdea7fe">Soberly into Syria </h2><p data-line-id="767bcd1755e44fcab693fc133191b798"><strong>SS:</strong> So what is your analysis of the Syrian war? </p><p data-line-id="99287c82fecc4426b5cd7f82d601237a"><strong>JS: In my opinion, it is a US-Saudi-Turkish war of regime change that is essentially stupid and against international law. The reason we have a refugee crisis is not because of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but because the US, the Saudis, and the Turks said in 2011 that Assad should be overthrown. It was a stupid idea – just as stupid as the idea of overthrowing Libya’s Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011 and Iraq’s Saddam Hussein in 2003.</strong></p><p data-line-id="8370da9bee38458695d8f9b2479cb13c"><strong>If I were a European politician, I would tell the US to stop focusing on violent US-led regime change, because that approach is flooding Europe with refugees and wreaking political havoc. But I would also reject the prevailing view that Europe needs to integrate its refugees for the long term. I think the right answer is to keep refugees safe, fed, in school, and healthy, and prepare them to return home to Syria as soon as possible. The mainstream argument in the US and Europe is that it’s not safe for refugees to return, because of the dictator. In my view, it’s not safe because of America’s pretentions that it gets to decide which governments rule in which parts of the world. We’re living out the disaster of that American fantasy again. Syria could be safe for Syrians, especially with the responsible unanimous backing of the UN Security Council.</strong><strong></strong></p><p data-line-id="d6211cf5dcf940c29da625292469abce"><strong>SS:</strong> But Assad is a real danger. </p><p data-line-id="19b0c99ebe044b18bc6d1b3c7eca7e71"><strong>JS: No, nothing like the danger of a continued proxy war in Syria and the open space for the Islamic State. Assad wasn’t such a danger from 2000 to 2010. Syria was a normal country with autocratic rule. It wasn’t a global humanitarian disaster. It became a disaster in the spring of 2011, and especially on August 18, 2011, when Barack Obama said that Assad must go. That was Obama’s worst foreign-policy blunder, and we’re still living with the consequences. Why would a US president say that another country’s president must go? The idea that the US can choose who should lead other countries has been a complete failure.</strong></p><p data-line-id="ad059d69c78849148fbe7ba50290327b"><strong>SS:</strong> So is Syria Obama’s Iraq? </p><p data-line-id="75aac1c09f374f708b7b5915d3bbcd9b"><strong>JS: Yes, but it’s not seen that way, because we live in a world of illusions. The illusion here is that Obama failed because he didn’t enforce his “line in the sand,” he didn’t do more or respond more aggressively. In fact, Obama signed executive orders – secret, but released in the media – directing the CIA to cooperate with Saudi Arabia to overthrow the Assad regime. The US pumped in a tremendous amount of weapons. The Saudis, Qataris, and Turks sent even more, and also sent in jihadists.</strong></p><p data-line-id="6a90db86b10843e8b7fa5ad46c9b63f3"><strong>SS:</strong> Why were they interested in overthrowing Assad? </p><p data-line-id="e5dfbfc858ed49a5a400fb8216b5ccbc"><strong>JS: Because he’s an ally of Russia and Iran, and because they thought that they could do it in 30 days. This was a geopolitical game, and it was both shockingly naïve and exceptionally arrogant. Obama, who’s a handwringer in general, said, “Okay, we’ll do this, but we won’t do that. We’ll do just a little bit, but we’ll let the Saudis, Turks, and Qataris take the lead.” But half a war is not half a disaster. We needed no war.</strong></p><p data-line-id="d1652d9bc6d84a76bc4f6ce48703d644"><strong>SS:</strong> What was the fight in Aleppo about? </p><p data-line-id="d666099a0ca04a31b125f6123d014935"><strong>JS: Assad and Russia were trying to root out the anti-Assad rebels. Who are these rebels? Who is funding and arming them? The CIA, Saudi Arabia, Turkey. So if we were to turn back the clock, Aleppo didn’t have to be destroyed. The reason it was destroyed is that the so-called US-led coalition is funding an anti-government rebellion in another country. The last time I checked the UN Charter – which is pretty frequently, actually – this behavior is completely prohibited under international law.</strong></p><p data-line-id="872aaa965e3e43ffa9ab1deb9542187c"><strong>SS:</strong> So this brings us back to Europe’s refugee issue and the question of why the refugees are fleeing. </p><p data-line-id="8ef69bbd445845d79d1e752cdcb54961"><strong>JS: Name one European leader who has asked that question. The whole debate in Europe focuses on whether to absorb the refugees or keep them in Turkey. Nobody asks the most basic question: why is this war raging in the first place?</strong></p><h2 data-line-id="897dd43294ef4dfc85ccc8f6c4f6bb8d">Trump and the West </h2><p data-line-id="2de18c4393a948d39d6c1122acd34a67"><strong>SS:</strong> So now we have Trump. Is he an isolationist? </p><p data-line-id="da3993d6ca514dfa92a9c7e666e53697"><strong>JS: No, he’s not a standard isolationist. I think American foreign policy is increasingly erratic and very dangerous, and I think it will become more so under Trump. I don’t predict anything except high variance.</strong></p><p data-line-id="da7cb15a5f4c47569cf488aa44313a3e"><strong>SS:</strong> Do you think he will withdraw from Eastern Europe? Russia’s ambitions haven’t changed. </p><p data-line-id="9c3b348ca31d497b8fa88bb5c9806029"><strong>JS: I don’t quite agree with that.</strong></p><p data-line-id="3eb07e35b30245e5b8506d26de9bfd3a"><strong>SS:</strong> Then why did Russia invade Ukraine, annex Crimea, and back the separatists in Donbas? </p><p data-line-id="0e1cbd3c77564e6eb833b09b43140a19"><strong>JS: I think that the US made a huge mistake in trying to flip Ukraine to NATO.</strong></p><p data-line-id="478847cc7c3141509f073bf15e272850"><strong>SS:</strong> Ukrainians wanted to join NATO. </p><p data-line-id="6a1ea063a92b42838812b4399570fbdf"><strong>JS: I know, but the US should say: “No way.”</strong></p><p data-line-id="362c8eeb48c040efbd7666d33f7935a5"><strong>SS:</strong> Why? </p><p data-line-id="0485819afee048c2aac42df0beb94114"><strong>JS: Because that’s geopolitics.</strong></p><p data-line-id="fc0c28bafdf3490ab119fb55695cd7ba"><strong>SS:</strong> They wanted to liberate themselves from Russia. If that’s their will, isn’t it their right? </p><p data-line-id="14125f37de5c4b87a1a316ca2c998868"><strong>JS: Sometimes actions that you truly believe are defensive are viewed on the other side as offensive. I believe that we lost a historic opportunity in 1991. I recall my first days of engagement with Poland and Russia (then still the Soviet Union), and I think of Mikhail Gorbachev’s idea for a zone of peace extending from Rotterdam to Vladivostok. One could call that idea naïve; I call it setting a target that we should have aimed at.</strong></p><p data-line-id="1384d5473aa5446db047391749acf95b"><strong>Instead, after 1991, US neoconservatives viewed the Soviet Union’s collapse as America’s victory. So it was America’s job to pick up the pieces, and for a while I was in agreement. I definitely supported Poland joining NATO, along with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, which I thought was justified in terms of basic geopolitics and security. When NATO expanded to the Baltic countries, however, I started to have misgivings: the closer NATO got to Russia’s own borders, the more the geopolitical West was creating unnecessary tripwires.</strong><strong></strong></p><p data-line-id="65d4853eb95d4e7d8b9bec26b188e84f"><strong>SS:</strong> What about the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, under which Ukraine surrendered its post-Soviet nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees from the US, China, Britain, and Russia? </p><p data-line-id="89881ecb823d46b28edb47cca9a311f8"><strong>JS: I think the big mistake really came with NATO’s approach to Georgia and Ukraine. At a fundamental level, Russia wants a security buffer. The Soviet Union’s brutal domination of Eastern Europe for four decades after World War II was not part of a plot to control the world; it was a strategy intended to prevent Germany from invading again. So my sense is that in 2008, the prospect of NATO positioned at Russia’s borders inside Georgia and Ukraine was the last straw for the Russian security state.</strong></p><p data-line-id="78827337d7cf4a179bd0c5361df34a3d"><strong>SS:</strong> Neither country was actually invited to join NATO. The Alliance sent an unclear message, and, where Russia is concerned, unclear messages from the West often create higher risks. </p><p data-line-id="219337e8e12f44e69409378219171f34"><strong>JS: The US was pressing – there were parties in the US that were pushing hard – to bring Ukraine and Georgia into NATO. Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili came to the US and gave a speech in New York, which I happened to attend, in which he envisaged NATO membership, trumpeted Georgia’s European identity, and even claimed that his country sits at the heart of Europe. Most of the attendees applauded loudly. “We’re with you,” they declared. I thought all of this was a dangerous geopolitical fantasy; a couple of months after he gave that speech, Russia’s invasion of his country proved that it was.</strong></p><p data-line-id="950f2a26821c46e781039aab81c2d481"><strong>SS:</strong> What should these countries do? Must they be subordinate to Russia? </p><p data-line-id="b8ad58e3d71548d4899a7a763d0674d5"><strong>JS: Imagine that Mexico’s leaders, having decided that Trump poses a grave threat to their country’s security, formed a military alliance with China. As far as I’m concerned, it would be their choice to make. But US policymakers – Republicans and Democrats alike – wouldn’t see it that way. I don’t know what would happen the next day, but I wouldn’t want to be in Mexico City, or perhaps anywhere in the world (which would all be threatened). This is reality. And it’s why a sensible US leader would say to the Ukrainians: we care for you, we love you, but we don’t want you in NATO, because we don’t want to provoke a conflict with the major power on your border.</strong></p><p data-line-id="4629e39159e749419728795c02e9bf0d"><strong>SS:</strong> Let’s look at the situation today. Ukraine is not in NATO; Poland and the Baltic countries are. And I’m interested in whether NATO will be there for us or not. </p><p data-line-id="6fe0631680b34c7bbcb2cf1810c37ffd"><strong>JS: My guess is that it will be, and I pray that Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn’t put my guess to the test. If Putin were to send troops into a Baltic state, I believe we’d have a war that could end the world.</strong></p><p data-line-id="59d6da881d7a4429a7f19ad0129fd1ed"><strong>SS:</strong> Don’t you think Trump would tolerate incursions by Russia? </p><p data-line-id="469b7940e42a4d398b9b096743685e28"><strong>JS: Russian incursions in Europe would be a disaster of possibly world-ending dimensions. I don’t think it’s going to happen. But, to answer your question, I don’t see there being much of an out for Trump, given the way the American political system works, the way our state works.</strong></p><p data-line-id="f6c7a38ef37c4b8dbcbe219be51f2d34"><strong>SS:</strong> They could try to find a solution with Russia. </p><p data-line-id="1e3269af280040fe98f8c7cf93f7ea60"><strong>JS: I don’t think that’s the issue. If there were an invasion of a NATO state, I would pray for our very survival.</strong></p><p data-line-id="114960a404cd40d48ae07adfadd67cc0"><strong>SS:</strong> Little green men speaking Russian could appear in Estonia, like they did in Crimea three years ago. They could work under the radar of Article Five. </p><p data-line-id="22944904123345719eb0c5c1387a20d9"><strong>JS: If that happens, we’ve got a world-class disaster.</strong></p><p data-line-id="3869672cae424410a922f7e709d30c3c"><strong>SS:</strong> America would react? </p><p data-line-id="4679e7578664475783ccd31428d99951"><strong>JS: Yes.</strong></p><p data-line-id="5e192ca6ca1949198dcdaf3147752229"><strong>SS:</strong> You’re sure of it? </p><p data-line-id="44328a57660f4a6aad9b9e7efbf92d74"><strong>JS: Yes.</strong></p><p data-line-id="cf6c56b7ab4645408773dfc2649122cf"><strong>SS:</strong> What’s your prediction about Trump’s role here? </p><p data-line-id="dd6090eef85b4738a511e8940405fb04"><strong>JS: What I see are a couple of instincts that are at odds with each other. One instinct is that we should have good relations with Putin. I think that that’s basically a good idea. He says we shouldn’t have been in these wars in the Middle East. I agree with that, too. My view is that we should be working with Putin in Syria to end the war there. My goal isn’t to leave Assad in power, but I think that would be the outcome of halting the effort to overthrow him, which would bring peace.</strong></p><p data-line-id="02035f6b753544ddaf7059ffdae74215"><strong>But Trump also says that he’s going to tear up the nuclear agreement with Iran, which in my view is ignorant and belligerent, and, if he follows through, could lead to terrible trouble. He may try to find a pretext or a substantive reason to cancel the deal. And if you look at Trump’s appointments, his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, gets very negative reactions in the Muslim world. The incoming CIA director, Michael Pompeo, is reportedly a similarly crude Islamophobe, whose anti-Iranian stance is a kind of ignorant reflex.</strong><strong></strong></p><p data-line-id="db35934363164678892ce149326ed470"><strong>No one should forget that the agency Pompeo will lead overthrew Iran’s democratically elected leader in 1953, installing a police state that lasted until 1979. Then the US backed Saddam Hussein in Iraq’s war with Iran from 1980 to 1988, and imposed sanctions that have lasted for almost 30 years. Attacking Iran has become a blind habit of US leaders.</strong><strong></strong></p><p data-line-id="1af918f978d641cfbcd6d10191785e9d"><strong>SS:</strong> I gather you don’t think Trump has a grand geopolitical strategy. </p><p data-line-id="94180b4dfaba4ac5afd9890cfbac53c6"><strong>JS: He’s a mass of contradictions and crudeness. One minute, he says the US shouldn’t have war in the Middle East; the next, he wants to escalate tensions with Iran. The US needs to pull back from the world, he says, but it also needs to build up its military and possibly have a trade war (or even a real war) with China. This is all a hodgepodge of half-baked ideas, not a strategy. And there are no statesmen on his team who could carry one out. It is all very dangerous indeed.</strong></p><h2 data-line-id="10745116750f4996870cb726fce1c3d9">Reconstructing American Politics </h2><p data-line-id="c1b867c874d1441497bda01dc516eac1"><strong>SS:</strong> What does that say about the state of American democracy? </p><p data-line-id="326cecf046b54a919840f854017a5b0f"><strong>JS: The US is witnessing a serious failure of its institutions. Incoherent foreign policy is a symptom of this. Public trust in government is at an all-time low, while distrust of all political figures is extraordinarily high. The two major parties exist only to finance campaigns. Many elite Americans just want to make money, and seem ready to give up democracy for tax cuts. We’re definitely in uncharted waters.</strong></p><p data-line-id="1e116ce2a2b64afda23ce71c8b59db06"><strong>SS:</strong> Do you think American civil society can stop Trump if he makes crazy moves? </p><p data-line-id="ad89b6c38cd04aa9b058a3bd3fea2a73"><strong>JS: On some things, yes. And perhaps a few top Republicans will tell Trump that he is not a tyrant. But we also need a revolution in politics. Representation has broken down. Americans believe – correctly, more often than not – that their congressmen serve their donors’ interests, not those of their constituents. And we have this extremely dangerous plebiscitary kind of presidentialism. If I could rewrite constitutions, I would replace presidentialism everywhere with a parliamentary system. If a country is lucky enough to have a traditional and respected constitutional monarch to promote the spirit of unity, even better.</strong></p><p data-line-id="d3dcacabdcdf41b5a071b6ce4ddd564c"><strong>SS:</strong> So you want party rule? </p><div class="support-ps a-b highlighted highlighted-standard highlighted-container-embedded">

That seems preferable to a system in which most of the electorate must agonize for four years over whether the head of government is crazy.</strong></p><p data-line-id="7930e57ecbde40988a17683b7ae7633e"><strong>SS:</strong> At the same time, parties everywhere are totally demoralized and people don’t want to join them. </p><p data-line-id="5a2f7e569ac6404dbc9938ebbaed7eb7"><strong>JS: The parties I most admire are the social-democratic parties, and they’re disappearing in most places, because their sociological base, which was trade unionism, has disappeared. We really need to reconstitute politics on a new sociological base that makes sense, given how people live, what young people do, how they earn their incomes, and so forth.

                &quot;Many elite Americans just want to make money, and seem ready to give up democracy for tax cuts. &quot;.<br/><br/>To me nothing describes better the paradox and the failure of neoliberalism. And despite Sachs assertion that &#39;economy&#39; isn&#39;t cause of the current worldwide problems, the type of &#39;economy&#39; practiced in the US , and exported to all capitalist countries, is the foundation upon which mistrust for major political parties and the raise of &#39;snake oil salesmen&#39; with no solution, aka &#39;populist parties&#39; are based.<br/><br/>Greed, like most other human failings, gone unchecked will destroy us. And it all starts with EDUCATION! <br/><br/>The current situation, leading to disaster, shall continue until such time the majority living in capitalist and democratic countries stops putting his own little illusory benefits ahead of the common good.  <br/><br/>The lack of fundamental understanding of economy is why a large fraction of US citizens blindly accept conditions which are not tolerated elsewhere, and then they blame poor outcomes for a large fraction of the population on migrants, Islam and other imaginary ills.<br/><br/>Medium and low income earners in the US favour low taxes because it puts few extra $ in their pocket totally unaware that this puts massive amount of wealth in the hand of very few, the 1%. The same people then complain that health care is very expansive, educating your children increases all the time, public education has a low standard.<br/><br/>They also enjoy reasonably low cost meals at many outlets, and the price would increase if restaurant owners were to pay a higher minimum wage to his staff. Yet a higher wage would mean greater tax take for the State, more money for schools,  and the elimination of the working-poor.<br/><br/>I think that dismissing &#39;the economy&#39; as one of the principal causes of the current situation is myopic.<br/>       <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                This is an excellent article that is underpinned by a good deal of sound analysis and robust commonsense. That said, it has some simplifications which need to be unpicked. In the first place, I do not believe that it is very productive nowadays to distinguish [and favor] &#39;refugees&#39; vis a vis economic migrants. Many of the civil and regional wars that create refugees are largely concerned with competitions for resources [which will intensify as climate change and resource depletion accelerate globally]. And all refugees see passports to the West as passports to opportunity. Secondly, taking those classified as refugees, we are talking about 60 million people already [and many, many more to come] -  this alone is enough to sink casual liberalism if they are given entry to advanced countries. Third, the growing underclasses in the West and their associated lower middle-class &#39;just-about-managing&#39; precariat constitute, in essence, another class of economic refugees - albeit geographically pinned down by poverty and cultural affiliation. Whatever can and can&#39;t be done, will have to start with tackling the problems of the latter. As regards development aid, this needs to be completely recast as performance-based with much more emphasis on direct budgetary support to achieve very specific goals [e.g. education sector funding for female students]. <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                Christine Constable’s comment on the Jeffery Sachs interview betrays a shallow understanding of both politics and economics, not to mention ethics and morality. Moreover, it betrays her quite limited memory span.<br/><br/>Constable states that the “problem we have in Europe is that many migrants, are hopelessly out of their depth, in terms of education; cultural identity; work ethic; educational level; and religious restrictions which have made many of the new ‘migrants’ unable to take on the usual role of a migrant”. Is she unwittingly ignoring the hundreds of thousands of doctors, scientists and professors who have come to Europe as migrants? <br/><br/>It is also revealing of her mind set when she refers to the millions in the Middle East, desperate to escape the devastation imposed upon them by war, as “migrants” rather than as “refugees”. Would it not be a shameful travesty to have referred to the Jews escaping the Nazis as “migrants” rather than as “refugees”?<br/><br/>More to the point, Constable refers uncritically to these refugees as “freeloaders”. Is she not aware that most of these refugees come from Syria, Libya, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen? And does she not recognise what is peculiarly common about these countries? Is she not aware that these are all countries whose economic infrastructure has been devastated by being attacked, bombed, invaded, or occupied by Western countries? And all within the past fifteen years which hardly requires a long memory span.<br/><br/>And finally, Constable states: “We have to find a fair; ethical and affordable new model…. but one thing for sure we are not going back and all countries have to start being more accountable; work harder and be more responsible and not expect the [W]est to keep filling the begging bowl – those days must come to an end”. I wonder, to what extent is she confusing the “begging” bowl with the “stealing” bowl? I wonder to what extent does Constable agree with Donald Trump, the new leader of the free world, when he declares that Iraq should compensate the United States to the tune of $1.5 trillion to cover the cost of invading and occupying the country?<br/><br/>What world does Christine Constable inhabit? And who is she cohabiting with? The mind boggles.<br/><br/>Ramez Ghazoul<br/>“Two Rivers”<br/>15 Willowmead Drive<br/>Prestbury<br/>Chesshire SK104BU<br/>England<br/>Email: ramez@artizana.co.uk <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                What these populations are objecting to is the Progressive Left&#39;s embrace of multiculturalism.  Multiculturalism is one aspect of the Progressive Left&#39;s ideology of one world order (government if you would like).  Many Europeans that have NOT bought into this ideology, which ideology is very chic among the so called &quot;intellectual&#39; elite, like their historic cultures, which date back centuries, just fine.  It&#39;s one thing for Muslims to emigrate in small numbers to, say, Norway with every intention of becoming Norwegian, but quite another thing for these immigrants to emigrate with the intention of turning Norway, or large parts of Norway, into an extension of the Islamic state from which they emigrated.  Europeans and Americans who have not bought into the Progressive Left&#39;s ideology that identifies Euro-American culture with white supremacy, racism, slavery and all the other real and imagined ills that have afflicted the world, have finally had it and are pushing back.  They are saying, wait a second you ivory tower pee brains, we are the ones who brought the modern world, with its dramatic decline in infant mortality, dramatic increase in health and longevity, dramatic decline in violence, dramatic increase in tolerance into being.  Don&#39;t treat us like we are a bunch of uneducated boneheaded deplorables. <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                &quot;Even the foundations of foreign policy are giving way. The Middle East crises are the result of America’s failure and fading global power, which are part of the social anguish many voters feel. Likewise, Brexit reflects a collapse in belief in the postwar order in Western Europe, which was forged during the Cold War but has now basically disintegrated.<br/><br/>I stopped right there because you obviously don&#39;t understand anything about why Trump/Brexit.  Either that, or your intentionally obfuscating.<br/><br/>The ME crisis is a result of Americas failure and fading power.  1/2 right.  Fading power?  I don&#39;t think so.  Failure?  Absolutely.  BUT, it is a failure I welcome and so take as a success.  Who died and put us in charge of regime changing the ME?  DIDNT WE LEARN ANYTHING IN IRAQ YOU FOREIGN POLICY GENIUS?  Better the enemy you know than the one you don&#39;t.  The only social anguish we feel is for the destruction of the countries of Syria and Libya.  With friends like you, who needs enemies?  YOU ARE THE PROBLEM.  WE DONT NEED YOUR GLOBAL STRATEGY.<br/><br/>As for Brexit, it reflects an entrenched globalist mindset in Brusells that cares not one whit for what THE PEOPLE IN THE UK WANT.  They want less immigration.  They don&#39;t want a hodge podge of competing minority interests taking over their country, and they don&#39;t want muslims demanding this and that (ie separate swimming pool hours for men and women, no pork in advertising etc etc.)<br/><br/>The globalists plan of dividing and conquering via mass 3d world immigration, and the resulting chaos it engenders, has been revealed to all.  Create problem - check.  Provide solution - check.  Your rule being the solution.  For now, we have put a stop to it.  We will rule for what is in OUR INTERESTS. <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

The effects of climate change will not only inflict the extreme example of a Malthusian solution but within 30 to 40 yeaqrs there will be massive migration pressures mainly targetting Europe.

                Excellent but discouraging assessment of our times. <br/><br/>Our long standing propensity to engage in violent regime change, first, to thwart the USSR and, next, to forcefully implant democracy in nations ill prepared for it have created chaos. <br/><br/>At a time when the planet needs real statesmen, we have  an erratic new president, Trump.  His shoot from the lip deportment does nothing to sooth troubled waters.  Instead, he exacerbates them.<br/><br/>Add to this the explosive growth of our species and we have the basis for enduring conflict if only for basic resources.

                Jeffrey, I would like to take you to task over your statement that Northern European countries want their society to remain cohesive and indigenous and to coin your term &quot;They like their society; they just don’t want newcomers.&quot;<br/><br/>I think this is disingenuous because I think the truth of the matter is no society minds if an immigrant moves to another country, gets involved, works hard, fits in and contributes.  Apart from racially segregated countries like Saudi Arabia, Japan and perhaps China most countries of the world value contributing migrants and new ideas.<br/><br/>The problem we have had in Europe is that many of these migrants, are hopelessly out of their depth, in terms of education; cultural identity; work ethic; educational level; and religious restrictions which have made many of the new &quot;migrants&quot; unable to take on the usual role of a migrant.<br/><br/>Added to that, it is clear that knowing (as many of these inward looking communities do) that they won&#39;t fit in and they won&#39;t get much of a the better life they are looking for, they have deliberately targeted Northern European countries because it is in those countries the most generous welfare and social provision is provided and knowing that much of the mainstream society are content not to integrate with these minority groups they can be pretty confident they will have plenty of taxpayer funds to live pretty much how they wish without having any obligation to integrate or contribute.<br/><br/>What you are seeing in places like Northern Europe is a kick back on freeloaders from outside their nations, who are themselves &quot;cherry picking&quot; where they aim for as a &quot;refugee&quot; or as a &quot;migrant&quot; - the bottom line is they have families, have set up religious communities and a parallel community and wish to bring other members of their communities out adding more burden to the host community who (finally) feel they are getting very little out of this situation.<br/><br/>The New Abnormal I would hasten to suggest, is the end game of the failed &quot;multicultural&quot; paradigm which the EU and the soft left have been peddling for the last 25 years which has ended in complete and abject failure.  It has created welfare dependant isolated and increasingly loathed inward looking and living communities, who are supported by mainstream society but make it very plain indeed they do not wish to become a part of such a society .<br/><br/>We now have huge problems in Europe, where people who have been given safe haven, new lives, welfare and education simply throw it back in our faces and commit appalling acts of societal damage and these are now happening on a weekly basis.<br/><br/>Mainstream Europe have had enough.  This is why there is very little support for Syrian Refugees and no interest in spreading these people around Europe - we have already seen what can happen and we don&#39;t want it.  This New Abnormal is a political problem, borne from lack of consultation with communities in the execution of foreign policies.  It is putting the so called human rights and needs of people who could well have created their own problems, ahead of the needs and taxpayers of European Countries.<br/><br/>The UN is not an institution that should lecture the people of Europe on populism, having been responsible for the waste and poor deployment of vast amounts of Aid funds with (let&#39;s face it) very little to show for it.  Long term projects to rebuild communities is only very latterly been something the UK has worked to effect, meanwhile the billions of aid that has been syphoned off over the decades leaves the UN charged with incompetence and if exhausted and fed up donors start to reject the &quot;old normal&quot; and start to question what these agencies have been doing with their cash then that is no bad thing.<br/><br/>The days of us stealing qualified immigrants for the benefit of the west is a zero sum game for these destabilised nations and continuing to attract the best and the most educated so they revert to poverty and misery is not an ethical policy any country let alone the UN should be endorsing.<br/><br/>We have to find a fair; ethical and affordable new model.  The New Abnormal is the state we are in until we transition - how we transition and what we transition to is on the table to be debated and argued about - but one thing is for sure we are not going back and all countries have to start being more accountable; work harder and be more responsible and not expect the west to keep filling the begging bowl - those days must come to an end. <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                Christine Constable’s comment on the Jeffery Sachs interview betrays a shallow understanding of both politics and economics, not to mention ethics and morality. Moreover, it betrays her quite limited memory span.<br/><br/>Constable states that the “problem we have in Europe is that many migrants, are hopelessly out of their depth, in terms of education; cultural identity; work ethic; educational level; and religious restrictions which have made many of the new ‘migrants’ unable to take on the usual role of a migrant”. Is she unwittingly ignoring the hundreds of thousands of doctors, scientists and professors who have come to Europe as migrants? <br/><br/>It is also revealing of her mind set when she refers to the millions in the Middle East, desperate to escape the devastation imposed upon them by war, as “migrants” rather than as “refugees”. Would it not be a shameful travesty to have referred to the Jews escaping the Nazis as “migrants” rather than as “refugees”?<br/><br/>More to the point, Constable refers uncritically to these refugees as “freeloaders”. Is she not aware that most of these refugees come from Syria, Libya, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen? And does she not recognise what is peculiarly common about these countries? Is she not aware that these are all countries whose economic infrastructure has been devastated by being attacked, bombed, invaded, or occupied by Western countries? And all within the past fifteen years which hardly requires a long memory span.<br/><br/>And finally, Constable states: “We have to find a fair; ethical and affordable new model…. but one thing for sure we are not going back and all countries have to start being more accountable; work harder and be more responsible and not expect the [W]est to keep filling the begging bowl – those days must come to an end”. I wonder, to what extent is she confusing the “begging” bowl with the “stealing” bowl? I wonder to what extent does Constable agree with Donald Trump, the new leader of the free world, when he declares that Iraq should compensate the United States to the tune of $1.5 trillion to cover the cost of invading and occupying the country?<br/><br/>What world does Christine Constable inhabit? And who is she cohabiting with? The mind boggles.<br/><br/>Ramez Ghazoul<br/> <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>
