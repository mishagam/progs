have some thoughts about the Fermi Paradox.it is interesting,because it is \neasy to understand why we are alone.all begin from a question \"who am I\".let me \ntalk these straightly. \n\n1:\"who am I\",what memory in my brain decide who I am.this is the only \nanswer.I can be lining,a Chinese or I can be Tom an American if I had adopted by \nan American family when I was a baby.so I am not must be lining by GOD,I am I \nnow just because my memory.\n\n2:what is life's meaning to us.all is feeling.I feel I am alive then I am \nalive.I feel who I am,then I am.it is work to everyone even scientist or \nilliteracy.we don't need anything to prove our life is live,just the feeling of \nour own is enough.\n\n3:our technology is developed very fast now.I think we can read our memory \nby some machine one day soon after.so maybe some day we can have our own memory \nin our hands.then what would we think about it.if we can read our memory then we \ncan expect the write technology.I have a idea about it now,we can read our \nmemory into a chip then transplant it into a baby's brain(use my sperm or other \nway).then following the baby's growing up,there like a sound deep in his heart \ntold him about his pre-life.then some day he old enough to recognize these \ninformation.then \"I\" am back.this just like parents educate their child who he \nis.just one outside and one inside.\n\n4:we can't reject whatever memory in our brain.unless there has already had \na set of memory.for example:I have my own memory,so you hard to change my \nidentity to myself.but if I am a baby,not any memory,so you told who I am,then I \nthink who I am.\n\n5:we all will die at some day.and what is death like?it is a example:\"are \nyou sleeping\"\"yes,I am.\"\"you lie to me\".we don't know we are in sleep and when \nwe were in sleep.it is the feeling of lose consciousness.so we can image a scene \nor feeling:\"are you died?\"\"yes,I am,I just died at 8:40 am.\"\"get the Fxxx \noff\".you never know you are died if you are died.even who you are.\n\n6:so if I am on my last day,and my memory(new updated) in my hand.I will \nthink if I put(write) this into a new body if I can live again.use my sperm to \nmake a new body.refer to above about what is life meaning for us,what is \n\"I\",what feeling is death.I call this new life is TA(Chinese spelling,the \nmeaning is she,he ,it).the whole process to me just like a sleep time.I fall \nsleep in an old body and wake up in a new body.\n\n7:TA's body can supply consciousness to me make me feel I am still alive \nbut just change a new body and my memory in TA's brain can decide I am still \nthat \"I\" .so TA's life is not so different to us now.we use our body's \nconsciousness to make up our memory and feel alive.we use our memory to decide \nwho I am.so we can be immortal from then in this way.the only way TA's life \ndifferent to us is TA do not need rely on the only body to survive.this kind of \nlife is totally freedom for us. \n\n8:do you think you will choose this way to prolong your life in your last \nday?or there are some people would do it?I think the desperation of when we face \ndeath will make us to make this choice,what can we lose when we face \ndeath.maybe there are still some people don't like this.but according to the \nhuge advantage of TA to us now.TA will totally replace the current human life \nstyle,those who don't like it will died eventually by nature.and their \ndescendant will accept this way.\n\n9:gene technology and AI technology can provide various body to us in the \nfuture.it has some standards.1)can run our memory well.2)can easily get energy \nfrom the circumstance 3)less necessary of energy to survive.why these standards \ncan be use.because more rely on energy or material then less freedom of life.I \ncall this stage of life is observer(advanced TA),just watch the universe run,not \nparticipated.just like us watch TV series.\n\n10:so human will \"disappeared\" in the future,our body can be any kind of \nshape.and we do not need to occupy any other planet.if we are interesting of \nthat planet and those life on it.we can be them (alien can be human live on the \nearth for a while and leave when it want to travel in the universe again with \nchange a new body to fit the new circumstance).\n\n11:this is the only way in our future.whenever we make the read&write \nmemory technology come true,TA will come.in 100 years or 1000 years?it is long \ntime to human but it is too short to universe.can we ban this technology \ndevelop?can we ban TA?I don't think so.because it is the best desire for us,we \nall(most) want live(health) as long as possible.ethics always changed to adapt \nthe human society's need.maybe it will delay TA come but can stop TA's \ncoming.\n\n12:we are alien too.at least I can confirm two common things to any alien \nin this universe.1)we are all creature, so we all have the strongest desire for \nlive.2)we all have intelligence.that mean we all have memory(data for run).so if \nthere is an alien civilization.they must meet the problem of their memory just \nlike us in their civilization's development.so they(alien) must in the same way \nI said before.this is the reason of why we are alone .all intelligence \ncreature's civilization will evolve to TA and \"disappeared\"\n\n13:3)the movie \"Big Hero 6 \",do you remember the ending of this story.Hiro Hamada \nuse the chip of Baymax'memory to make the past Baymax come back.you see,if we \ncan have our memory in hand.everyone would do it.if you search the key word \n\"read memory technology\"or other words on google,you can find many articles.it's \nnot my whim,we actually on the way to TA.TA is our destination can't avoid.if \nyou follow the clue

And as far as I can tell, all this \"end of the world\" stuff will happen before we get to that stage.\u003c/p>\u003cp>So, if God has this plan for all his childre\" he has created, on all the other planets he has placed people on, then Possibly he will bring a certain civilization up to the point where we are, just before they can venture into space, and then the end will come. And they will go to \"heaven\" and recieve thier \"mansions in heaven.\" if they were good, or go to a \"hell\" if they werent.\u003c/p>\u003cp>To me, THAT is the great barrier. God ends it all before a civilization can get to that stage of traveling into space. Thats why we have not been contacted by other civilizations.\u003c/p>\u003cp>5.

<p>I'm familiar with the Fermi paradox but after reading this article I'm again surprised that scientists are VERY bad at History, prospective and anthropology.</p><p>Saying that there should be other alien civilisations out there that have exponentially evolved as to be able to notice and visit us, is like saying that our own human civilizationS are developing exponentially and never collapse.</p><p>The truth is that human civilisations are barely 50.000 year old at the maximum, and that more than a thousand regional or global civilisations have risen and fallen in this time. And overall this is a speck of dust in just the timeline of our own species, let alone that of our planet or the universe. And there's no much further we could go in terms of ideas, knowledge and technologies.</p><p>So the probabilistic chances that we or any other alien civilisation, who are a specks of dust in the timeline of the universe as much as we are, would have stumbled on other intelligent civilisation in the very vast distances of the universe is kind of wrong to start with.</p><p>If humanity was 500.000 or 1 millions year old I would understand that we could think that in such a period time (which, even then, is a tiny fraction of the universe timeline) we haven't met anyone, but truth is there's not much further we can go with technology, 8 or 10 century more, and this is IF we don't destroy ourselves first. So thinking that a species that is barely 50.000 and has already travelled in space would coïncide with the life of other species scattered in the universe in the span of 14 billions year is not considering time right.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately,  I think there are two major factors which would make it unlikely we would  ever be able to engage with extraterrestrial intelligent life 1) the distances involved will make it impossible for intelligent organic organisms to ever be able to meet/interact with us,  distance versus life span.  2) regular  natural apocalyptic events will make it impossible for species to reach a level of technological advancement to ever be able to traverse the massive distances of space.</p>

<p>This is a great article! There's one other possibility that I've always considered. I wonder whether we ARE the alien life we've been searching for. I wonder if cells were sent to earth in a desperate attempt to sustain life from some other dying world, or perhaps even as an experiment. You  say yourself that we haven't been able to reproduce that moment where life began. Maybe life is not really native to earth! </p>

<p>I recently read Paul Davies' book "The Eerie Slience: Renewing our Search for Alien Intelligence".  He refers to work done by Geoffrey Landis and then extended by Robin Hanson on modelling interstellar migration and colonization by a civilization based on "reasonable assumptions".  It turns out this can be done using something called "percolation theory" and the results are (perhaps) surprising.  The net result is not that every part of the galazy become colonised, but that there may be significant bypassed areas.  The area of space colonized would tend to form a fractal pattern with gaps existing at all spatial scales.  So, a possibility is that we find ourselves to be in a gap, at the moment.  Note that this could explain the lack of visitation, but not necessarily the failure (to date) of SETI.</p>

<p>.I have some thoughts about the Fermi <a href="http://paradox.it/" rel="nofollow">Paradox.it</a> is interesting,because it is <br>easy to understand why we are alone.all begin from a question "who am I".let me <br>talk these straightly.</p><p>1:"who am I",what memory in my brain decide who I am.this is the only <br>answer.I can be lining,a Chinese or I can be Tom an American if I had adopted by <br>an American family when I was a <a href="http://baby.so/" rel="nofollow">baby.so</a> I am not must be lining by GOD,I am I <br>now just because my memory.</p><p>2:what is life's meaning to us.all is feeling.I feel I am alive then I am <br>alive.I feel who I am,then I <a href="http://am.it/" rel="nofollow">am.it</a> is work to everyone even scientist or <br>illiteracy.we don't need anything to prove our life is live,just the feeling of <br>our own is enough.</p><p>3:our technology is developed very fast now.I think we can read our memory <br>by some machine one day soon <a href="http://after.so/" rel="nofollow">after.so</a> maybe some day we can have our own memory <br>in our hands.then what would we think about it.if we can read our memory then we <br>can expect the write technology.I have a idea about it now,we can read our <br>memory into a chip then transplant it into a baby's brain(use my sperm or other <br>way).then following the baby's growing up,there like a sound deep in his heart <br>told him about his pre-life.then some day he old enough to recognize these <br>information.then "I" am back.this just like parents educate their child who he <br>is.just one outside and one inside.</p><p>4:we can't reject whatever memory in our brain.unless there has already had <br>a set of memory.for example:I have my own memory,so you hard to change my <br>identity to myself.but if I am a baby,not any memory,so you told who I am,then I <br>think who I am.</p><p>5:we all will die at some day.and what is death like?it is a example:"are <br>you sleeping""yes,I am.""you lie to me".we don't know we are in sleep and when <br>we were in <a href="http://sleep.it/" rel="nofollow">sleep.it</a> is the feeling of lose <a href="http://consciousness.so/" rel="nofollow">consciousness.so</a> we can image a scene <br>or feeling:"are you died?""yes,I am,I just died at 8:40 am.""get the Fxxx <br>off".you never know you are died if you are died.even who you are.</p><p>6:so if I am on my last day,and my memory(new updated) in my hand.I will <br>think if I put(write) this into a new body if I can live again.use my sperm to <br>make a new body.refer to above about what is life meaning for us,what is <br>"I",what feeling is death.I call this new life is TA(Chinese spelling,the <br>meaning is she,he ,it).the whole process to me just like a sleep time.I fall <br>sleep in an old body and wake up in a new body.</p><p>7:TA's body can supply consciousness to me make me feel I am still alive <br>but just change a new body and my memory in TA's brain can decide I am still <br>that "I" .so TA's life is not so different to us now.we use our body's <br>consciousness to make up our memory and feel alive.we use our memory to decide <br>who I <a href="http://am.so/" rel="nofollow">am.so</a> we can be immortal from then in this way.the only way TA's life <br>different to us is TA do not need rely on the only body to survive.this kind of <br>life is totally freedom for us.</p><p>8:do you think you will choose this way to prolong your life in your last <br>day?or there are some people would do it?I think the desperation of when we face <br>death will make us to make this choice,what can we lose when we face <br>death.maybe there are still some people don't like this.but according to the <br>huge advantage of TA to us now.TA will totally replace the current human life <br>style,those who don't like it will died eventually by nature.and their <br>descendant will accept this way.</p><p>9:gene technology and AI technology can provide various body to us in the <br><a href="http://future.it/" rel="nofollow">future.it</a> has some standards.1)can run our memory well.2)can easily get energy <br>from the circumstance 3)less necessary of energy to survive.why these standards <br>can be use.because more rely on energy or material then less freedom of life.I <br>call this stage of life is observer(advanced TA),just watch the universe run,not <br>participated.just like us watch TV series.</p><p>10:so human will "disappeared" in the future,our body can be any kind of <br>shape.and we do not need to occupy any other planet.if we are interesting of <br>that planet and those life on it.we can be them (alien can be human live on the <br>earth for a while and leave when it want to travel in the universe again with <br>change a new body to fit the new circumstance).</p><p>11:this is the only way in our future.whenever we make the read&amp;write <br>memory technology come true,TA will <a href="http://come.in/" rel="nofollow">come.in</a> 100 years or 1000 years?it is long <br>time to human but it is too short to universe.can we ban this technology <br>develop?can we ban TA?I don't think so.because it is the best desire for us,we <br>all(most) want live(health) as long as possible.ethics always changed to adapt <br>the human society's need.maybe it will delay TA come but can stop TA's <br>coming.</p><p>12:we are alien <a href="http://too.at/" rel="nofollow">too.at</a> least I can confirm two common things to any alien <br>in this universe.1)we are all creature, so we all have the strongest desire for <br>live.2)we all have intelligence.that mean we all have memory(data for run).so if <br>there is an alien civilization.they must meet the problem of their memory just <br>like us in their civilization's <a href="http://development.so/" rel="nofollow">development.so</a> they(alien) must in the same way <br>I said before.this is the reason of why we are alone .all intelligence <br>creature's civilization will evolve to TA and "disappeared"</p><p>13:3)the movie "Big Hero 6 ",do you remember the ending of this story.Hiro Hamada <br>use the chip of Baymax'memory to make the past Baymax come back.you see,if we <br>can have our memory in hand.everyone would do it.if you search the key word <br>"read memory technology"or other words on google,you can find many <a href="http://articles.it/" rel="nofollow">articles.it</a>'s <br>not my whim,we actually on the way to TA.TA is our destination can't avoid.if <br>you follow the clue to going on.you will find a lot of very interesting things <br>not only the theory of Fermi Paradox I had said.</p>

<p>What does this have to do with the article? Assuming God created everything, that would include everything in the universe, as mentioned above, and we're still left with the paradox of "why did God create all that other shit if we're the only ones that matter?" or "If we're not the only ones that matter, is there a Jesus on every planet with life, for the same reasons?" ect. ect. <br>You can formulate an ultimate creator into the paradox, but resting on the 7th day doesn't really apply to the conversation.</p>

<p>Here's a thought experiment for you.  Imagine you're born into a family that happens to be Muslim.  What religion would you be?  Would you believe in Jesus despite what your parents taught you?  Now imagine you're born into a family that happens to be Jewish.  What would your beliefs be then?  Try stepping outside yourself and honestly think about this.  Let me know what you figure out.  [I wrote this to someone else online a while back who posted something resembling your post, and in their response they again talked about Christianity.  Not a great job of stepping outside themselves.  So that's a challenge for you.  In your response post, if there is one, don't talk about Christianity.]</p>

<p>I come up with a few conclusions to why we dont know about other civilizations. Some you mentioned,</p><p>1. they are all ready here, and we don't know about it.</p><p>2. they are watching us and waiting.</p><p>3. they don't care because we are too primitive.</p><p>4. This is from a religeous point of view, so you can accept it or not. I have been wondering about this for a while, and this is MY OPINION. I am a Christian. A mormon to be exact. I believe in God, and that God created the universe. He Created ALL the planets and suns etc. in the universe.</p><p>He also created all the life in the universe. Weather in his image or whatever he decided them to look like. We have what we call the "Plan of Salvation", where we as Gods Children, come to earth to be tested and tried, to live the commandments and return to live with God, Or not. And as alot of Christians believe in the Second Coming of Christ. But we also believe that after the millenium, we will all be ressurrected and go to live With God, or in Various Kingdoms God has prepared.</p><p>Now this part is Gospel according to Dave.</p><p>We haven't reached space faring, planet colonizing achievement in our civilization yet. And as far as I can tell, all this "end of the world" stuff will happen before we get to that stage.</p><p>So, if God has this plan for all his childre" he has created, on all the other planets he has placed people on, then Possibly he will bring a certain civilization up to the point where we are, just before they can venture into space, and then the end will come. And they will go to "heaven" and recieve thier "mansions in heaven." if they were good, or go to a "hell" if they werent.</p><p>To me, THAT is the great barrier. God ends it all before a civilization can get to that stage of traveling into space. Thats why we have not been contacted by other civilizations.</p><p>5. We have been visited by other civilizations. What do you think Angels are?? They certaily don't live on earth.</p>

<p>What about the simple explanation that long distance space travel is simply not technologically feasible. It doesn't matter how technologically advanced a civilisation is if the task at hand is flat impossible. It can't be done no matter how many billions of years have elapsed since the dawn of life.</p><p>Space is a vast and barren place, and energy (and other resources) are highly disbursed rather than concentrated. This is a potential problem, in an analogous way to how the second law of thermodynamics inevitably spells long term doom for life in the universe. Energy and other resources in the universe simply may not be abundant enough in sufficiently concentrated doses to support long distance space travel; keep any on-board inhabitants alive; and to support self-replicating space vessels. You have to generate a constant energy surplus throughout that postulated 3.7m years. Perhaps generating such an energy surplus in a cold, dark, and barren universe isn't possible?</p><p>For me, this is the simplest and most obvious explanation - certainly relative to the more 'creative' explanations that are sometimes raised - but it is an explanation that is almost never proffered. I don't understand why. Occam's razor...</p><p>Btw it would be interesting to see what Elon Musk's take on this is if you ever have the chance to ask...</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that is bliss-inducing ignorance.  Who says space is too big to be traversed?  We don't know that for sure.  Right now it is, but it has been postulated that space-time can be bended.  A million light years might be travelled in one Earth minute, for all you know.  Go back a mere 200 years, and people would've called you crazy had you proposed sending spacecraft to Mars or Pluto, which has now happened.</p><p>Re: energy sources for space travel, already now, there is such a thing as quantum vacuum plasma thrusters (QVPT) which can deliver thrust to spacecraft without any fuel. Small as the thrust force is now, is it too far-fetched to say someday scientists will discover a way to amplify its effects?  Imagine that: energy derived from nothing.</p><p>Occam's Razor only applies to phenomenon of which you have full knowledge, not to great unknowns because you cannot account for all possible factors yet.  What if one day, scientists found a way to harness energy from the dark matter that comprises 80-85% of the known universe? You would've solved the problem of energy sourcing.  The reason such brilliant minds postulate such wildly creative scenarios is because they know that they don't know (yet).  You, on the other hand, are so cocksure.</p>

<p>War or destruction is not a possibility for an interstellar capable civilization that could bow up stars or even galaxies. So what does an intelligent advanced civilization do about more primitive evolving intelligent beings? The "Interstellar organization" has a "hands off" policy while they wait without revealing themselves until the evolving new intelligent species either learns to live with themselves and other beings unlike themselves or destroys themselves (passing perfect judgment on themselves) as their technology evolves. Few new species probably make it and I doubt we will but hope I am wrong. How many polluted or radioactive worlds that had "?intelligent"  species are out there? I think millions or billions of such planets exist that never "made" it.</p>

As an alien I can understand why they wouldn't want to make contact with the descendents of Vilings and Mongols.</p>

<p>People (by and large) fail to understand what "Life" truly is, because they tend to define it only within the frame of relative understanding that is closest to their own set of values:  that is, humans define "intelligent life" as humanoid.  Botanists describe life as anything that grows from the soil or in the ocean.  The fact is, Life has existed for over 14 billion years:  our universe has been "alive" since its creation.  Galaxies, black holes, solar systems, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, cosmic rays, atoms, protons, neutrons, quarks, and beyond -- even empty space -- *everything* is *alive* because it *exists*.  Stars have been communicating to us for billions of years.  They shine in the night sky and tell us "Here I am! Look at me! Check out my lovely family of planets and moons!"</p><p>Fermi simply missed the bigger picture, entirely.</p>

What you are saying is that our definition of life is wrong, but the math works out the same way regardless of semantics. You can just as easily rephrase the paradox as reading intelligent, organic, lifeforms and the math would still point towards hundreds of thousands of such lifeforms in our galaxy.</p>

<p>And what if the Big Bang was not an act of creation? Hm.. may be it was a death<br>of something super intelligent, which has transferred from one stage of existence over to another? Therefore, what we witness now (and for a verrrry short time) is<br>a process of decaying, and we "humans", so proud and "magnificent" are just worms on the "dead body" of the universe, which used to be alive and vibrant, and of course ultimately wise. That might be another theory, which we might explore, if our sick ego, and incredible vanity permits us to do.</p>
