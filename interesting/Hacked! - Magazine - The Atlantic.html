	<h1>Hacked!</h1>
	
	<p class="blurb">As email, documents, and almost every aspect of our 
professional and personal lives moves onto the “cloud”—remote servers we
 rely on to store, guard, and make available all of our data whenever 
and from wherever we want them, all the time and into eternity—a brush 
with disaster reminds the author and his wife just how vulnerable those 
data can be. A trip to the inner fortress of Gmail, where Google 
developers recovered six years’ worth of hacked and deleted e‑mail, 
provides specific advice on protecting and backing up data now—and gives
 a picture both consoling and unsettling of the vulnerabilities we can 
all expect to face in the future.</p>			<h5 class="author">By <span class="authors">James Fallows</span></h5>

<p><img src="Hacked%21%20-%20Magazine%20-%20The%20Atlantic_files/fallows-200.jpg" align="right"></p>

<p icap="on"> <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">On April 13 </span>of
 this year, a Wednesday, my wife got up later than usual and didn’t 
check her e‑mail until around 8:30 a.m. The previous night, she had put 
her computer to “sleep,” rather than shutting it down. When she opened 
it that morning to the Gmail account that had been her main 
communications center for more than six years, it seemed to be 
responding very slowly and jerkily. She hadn’t fully restarted the 
computer in several days, and thought that was the problem. So she 
closed all programs, rebooted the machine, and went off to make coffee 
and have some breakfast. </p>
<p>When she came back to her desk, half an hour later, she couldn’t log 
into Gmail at all. By that time, I was up and looking at e‑mail, and we 
both quickly saw what the real problem was. In my inbox I found a 
message purporting to be from her, followed by a quickly proliferating 
stream of concerned responses from friends and acquaintances, all about 
the fact that she had been “mugged in Madrid.” The account had seemed 
sluggish earlier that morning because my wife had tried to use it at 
just the moment a hacker was taking it over and changing its 
settings—including the password, so that she couldn’t log in again. The 
bogus message that had just gone out to me and everyone else in her 
Gmail contact list was this: </p>
<p></p><blockquote>
From: Deb Fallows &lt;debfallows@gmail.com&gt; <br><br>
Date: Wed, Apr 13, 2011 at 8:45 AM <br><br>
Subject: Problem <br><br>
To:  <br><br>
now this might come as a suprise to you,but I made a quick trip to 
Madrid in Spain and was mugged.My bag,valuables,credit cards and 
passport all gone.The embassy has cooperated by issuing a temporary 
passport.I need funds to settle outstanding hotel bills,ticket and other
 expenses. <br><br>
To be honest,i don’t have money with me at the moment. I’ve made contact
 with my bank but the best they could do was to send me a new card in 
the mail which will take 2-4 working days to arrive here from DC. I need
 you to lend me some Money to sort my self out of this predicament, i 
will pay back once i get this over with because i need to make a last 
minute flight. <br><br>
Western Union or MoneyGram is the fastest option to wire funds to me. 
Let me know if you need my details(Full names/location) to effect a 
transfer. You can reach me via hotel’s desk phone and the number is, +34
 981 600916867. <br><br>
  <br><br>
Thanks. <br><br>
Deb 
</blockquote>
<p>I’m using her real e‑mail address because at this stage there’s no 
point in “protecting” it. Someone had obviously taken over her account 
and was using it as a crude spamming tool—or at least what we considered
 crude. Who hadn’t seen countless messages like this before? Which of 
her friends would really think that Deb would capitalize “Money,” type a
 paragraph’s worth of sentences with no spaces separating them, or say 
that she had gone to “Madrid in Spain”? And, indeed, the great majority 
of notes were warnings that her account had been hacked and was being 
used to send out fraud-spam; some included gratuitous tips about the 
need to be more careful in online life.  </p>
<p>But a touching handful of the notes came from people who took the 
plea at face value. They wrote to me; they replied to Deb’s account; a 
few even phoned from South America, Asia, the Midwest, and Australia to 
find out how they could help. That was the first indication that this 
would be more than a minor nuisance. What if some of them actually sent 
cash? </p>
<p>The more serious sign of the potential scale of our problems came 
later in the day. Google offers a variety of automated ways for users to
 regain control of Gmail and other accounts they think have been hacked.
 The automated routines, plus an online forum moderated by Google 
employees, are the only help Google offers. With hundreds of millions of
 active Gmail accounts to manage—that’s as specific as Google will be 
about its user base—operating in 54 languages worldwide, the relative 
handful of human beings on Gmail’s support staff could not even pretend 
to offer live one-on-one service. The same is true of Yahoo, Microsoft’s
 Hotmail, Facebook, Skype, eBay, and the other big operators of 
“cloud”-based systems.  </p>
<p>As a reminder: in cloud-based systems, users turn the management and 
protection of crucial data and services over to third parties, and then 
call up information as necessary via the Internet. For individuals, the 
appeal is that e-mail held “in the cloud” by Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, 
et cetera, is available wherever there is an Internet connection, rather
 than being lodged on any one machine. If a corporation is large enough,
 it may operate its own internal cloud, or turn to large-scale suppliers
 like Amazon—which has a cloud-server business apart from its familiar 
retail functions—to store and protect data. </p>
<p>The first and easiest automated step was to fill out a password-reset
 form. Doing so prompted Google to send reset instructions to the 
mobile-phone number or alternate e‑mail address listed as “recovery 
options” for Deb’s account. That alternate e‑mail account, with AOL, was
 no longer active, and in any case whoever had taken over her Gmail 
settings seemed to have removed or changed the information. The next 
line of defense was to submit a form reporting that an account had been 
taken over or compromised. We had sent in that form within 30 minutes of
 discovering the problem, giving my Gmail address as the new contact 
point. Meanwhile my wife logged into a secondary Gmail account she had 
previously created, and began writing to friends and family as quickly 
as she could to explain what was going on. </p>
<p>While we waited for results from Google, we began to hear, by phone 
and via our other e‑mail accounts, from people who had written back to 
Deb “in Madrid” to find out more about her predicament. They had all 
quickly gotten responses, from an account meant to look similar to hers 
but with a one-letter difference: debbfallows@gmail.com. We learned 
later that, as a predictable part of a hacking attack on Gmail, Yahoo, 
Hotmail, or any other e‑mail service, an attacker will change the 
settings so that all incoming mail is forwarded to a new, 
similar-seeming address—and then deleted from the real account, to make 
it harder for the real user to know, later on, who had responded to the 
scam. And whoever was on the other end of the exchange had gathered at 
least enough personal info to sustain a round or two of exchanges with 
concerned friends. For instance, Deb’s mother in Florida, 89 years old, 
had written back immediately to say that the message was a fraud, 
signing the note “Mom.” Her message went instead to debbfallows, who 
sent this reply: </p>
<p></p><blockquote>
From: “Deb Fallows” &lt;debbfallows@gmail.com&gt; <br><br>
Date: Wed, 13 Apr 2011 14:23:23 +0000 <br><br>
Subject: Re: terrible scam <br><br>
Hey mom, <br><br>
I am too old to raise a false alarm. I was mugged last night under gun point. <br><br>
 <br><br>
I need €1,500. Below are my details you for the transfer,kindly get this done from any Western union office close to you: <br><br>
 <br><br>
Receiver Name: Deborah Fallows <br><br>
Location: Madrid,Spain <br><br>
 <br><br>
Don’t forget to email the Money control number(MTCN) to enable me pick 
up the funds. I promise to pay back once I return to DC. Expecting to 
hear from you. <br><br>
 <br><br>
Other than this,how are you doing? <br><br>
 <br><br>
Xoxo, <br><br>
Deb 
</blockquote>
<p>We thought that “other than this” was a nice touch. Other friends who
 replied got other variations, all with the same basic 
social-engineering info—the knowledge that our regular home was “in DC,”
 and that I was her spouse. A friend in New York was ready to send 
money, if he could only talk with Deb on the phone to be sure. His 
exchange with the hacker finally petered out this way: </p>
<p></p><blockquote>
I had to check out of the hotel due to accumulated bills. I am in a cyber cafe at the moment,sorry I cannot afford a call card. <br><br>
 <br><br>
Xoxo <br><br>
Deb 
</blockquote>
<p>So far, this was embarrassing, and possibly costly to the most 
openhearted or trusting among our acquaintances, but not worse than 
that. We’d returned only a few days earlier from a two-month stay in 
China. Perhaps this was one more predictable aftereffect, like my 
chronic cough? Things seemed to be improving when, around 2 p.m., a 
message from Google’s help system arrived in my account, with 
instructions on how Deb could at last reset her password and regain 
control of her information.  </p>
<p>She did so, and logged into her Gmail account with enormous relief, 
which lasted perhaps five seconds. When she looked at her Inbox, and her
 Archives, and even the Trash and Spam folders in her account, she 
found—absolutely nothing. Of her allocated 7 gigabytes of storage, 0.0 
gigabytes were in use, versus the 4+ gigabytes shown the day before. Six
 years’ worth of correspondence and everything that went with it were 
gone. All the notes, interviews, recollections, and attached photos from
 our years of traveling through China. All the correspondence with and 
about her father in the last years of his life. The planning for our 
sons’ weddings; the exchanges she’d had with subjects, editors, and 
readers of her recent book; the accounting information for her projects;
 the travel arrangements and appointments she had for tomorrow and next 
week and next month; much of the incidental-expense data for the 
income-tax return I was about to file—all of this had been erased. It 
had not just been put in the “Trash” folder but permanently deleted. </p>
<p>In some other circumstances, we might have had a calmly reasoned 
discussion about whether it made sense to have so much emotionally and 
practically precious information in a single, now evidently vulnerable, 
place. Even in these real circumstances, we realized that with enough 
persistent effort she could have eventually rewoven parts of the missing
 fabric. Her mother still had some of the messages Deb had sent about 
her father, I had some of what she’d written and done in China; bit by 
bit she might get some things back. For the moment, all we could do was 
clean up some of the traces of the attack that remained in her 
account—the command to forward all incoming messages to DebbFallows, the
 bogus e‑mail address and phone numbers for the password-recovery 
routines—and fill out another form on the Google help site, this one to 
request an automated recovery of deleted e‑mail. </p>





<p icap="on">I<span style="text-transform: uppercase;">t was at </span>about
 this time that I started thinking about the ramifications of this 
problem beyond our own situation, desperate as that situation felt to us
 just then. Through more than 30 years of computing, I’d had my ups and 
downs with data storage. My very first computer, a Processor Technology 
SOL-20, was nearly incinerated along with all of its electronic contents
 when a lightning bolt hit our house in the early 1980s. (The contents 
included the notes and drafts for my book <i>National Defense</i>, which
 fortunately I’d printed out on paper.) Hard disks fail; laptops get 
dropped. But I’d never before imagined the chance of total, 
catastrophic, years’ worth of loss. This was a loss whose sweeping 
magnitude was possible only because my wife had entrusted her data 
exclusively to the most professional of pros: Google’s operation in the 
cloud. If we had thought that data security was strictly up to us, we’d 
have made backups of some sort to limit the potential damage—much as we 
would lay in our own firewood and keep our own chickens and cows to be 
sure we’d never freeze or starve if normal supplies were cut off. In my 
own version of Depression-style thinking, and with that lightning strike
 in mind, I had always made triply redundant backups of anything that 
mattered to me, including e‑mail. Local on-disk backups of Gmail 
archives, via programs like Eudora and Thunderbird—or both. Online 
backups of those local backups, through SugarSync and Dropbox—and then 
more local backups on my other machines. But my wife had trusted the 
cloud and Google. And now? </p>
<p>Her move to the cloud had coincided with the larger and irreversible 
shift of business, personal, governmental, and every other sort of 
activity to the cloud. The shift is irreversible because it brings so 
many advantages. Who would go back to searching for addresses on paper 
maps after using online mapping services? Needing to save and file 
canceled paper checks rather than inspecting them online, or doing a 
thousand other chores in pre-cloud form? In addition to these corporate 
and public services, whose users are increasingly conducting their 
business and storing their data in the cloud rather than on paper, our 
personal data has moved to the cloud as well, with the premise that 
we’ll be able to retrieve and work on our correspondence, our contacts, 
our photos and documents, from any computer connected to the Internet. 
But, of course, the more we rely on the cloud, the more we expose 
ourselves to its vulnerabilities. These include the breakdowns that 
affect any complex system. When much of Washington had a multiday power 
outage after a snowstorm last January, the loss of Internet service 
seemed almost as crippling as the loss of light and heat. They also 
include deliberate attacks—for criminal gain, spying, or sabotage—that 
are sure to increase as the value of cloud-based information does. 
“Where the money is, that is where the criminals will go,” a former 
National Security Agency official named Ken Silva, who now works as an 
online-security specialist for Booz Allen Hamilton, told me this summer.
 “Where the sensitive information is concentrated, that is where the 
spies will go. This is just a fact of life.” The more important online 
storage becomes, the more relentlessly it will be under attack.  </p>
<p>For instance: Chastened by my wife’s experience, I decided to make my
 online passwords “stronger,” and to shift to an online storage site to 
manage them. The following week, that site—LastPass.com—was itself 
hacked and some of its data stolen. (I still use it, as I’ll explain.) 
At around the same time, the anonymous hacker group LulzSec, operating 
under the motto “Laughing at your security since 2011” (the first part 
of the name is phonetic for “LOLs”; the second stands for “security”), 
started functioning as a kind of tech-world version of WikiLeaks, 
penetrating corporate sites and then publishing large numbers of 
usernames and passwords.  </p>
<p>Sony, Citibank, Veterans Affairs, major hospitals, tech firms like 
Intel, Cisco, and Google—I stopped keeping track of the institutions 
that announced intrusions, after security experts told me that 
essentially every major organization suffers ongoing attacks. But I used
 the shock of my wife’s experience as an occasion to educate myself 
about the vulnerabilities and new rules of operation in the cloud era, 
as they involve corporations and institutions as well as individuals. 
What I found is not all good news, but it is better than I might have 
feared. It includes some hopeful signs about the way corporations and 
governments are defending their data, and manageable practical steps 
individuals can take to avoid scares like the one my wife had that day. 
 </p>
<p>I say “scare” rather than “trauma” because—to skip ahead in the 
story—my wife eventually got her e‑mail back, through Google’s recent 
“Undeletion Project,” as I called it when I learned of it. But it was a 
long time before that happened, and our attitude toward Google got much 
worse before it got better. I concentrate on Google here because that’s 
where we had our problem, and more generally because of its exceptional 
international role. But everyone I spoke with there and at other 
organizations emphasized that our experiences with Gmail—the brush with 
disaster and subsequent revelation of the gulf between data 
professionals’ view of reality and what the rest of us assume—were not 
exceptional at all but were variations on a cloud-wide theme. And our 
experience and revelation would apply to most people using most online 
services, including Apple’s pending “iCloud” services and Microsoft’s 
continuing movement of Windows services to the cloud. </p>
<p icap="on">I<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"> felt antsy rather </span>than
 sleepy on that first night after the attack, as I kept fielding calls 
and e‑mails from friends and spending time on hold trying to change our 
credit-card numbers. So I was still at the computer a little after 2 
a.m., monitoring both of our e‑mail accounts, when Google’s recovery 
team sent its response to our “My e‑mail is missing” form. I’ve 
boldfaced the parts that jumped out at me: </p>

Hello, <br><br>
 <br><br>
We have processed your request to recover mail that may have been 
inappropriately purged from your Gmail account. Any previously deleted 
messages that we were able to recover will now be in your account in a 
newly added label called ‘recovered &lt;time stamp&gt;.’ If the 
message(s) you are looking for are not in this label, <b>they unfortunately are not recoverable</b>. <br><br>
If you have not already done so, we suggest that you take the steps 
outlined in our Security Checklist to ensure the security of your 
account: 
http://mail.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=checklist.cs&amp;tab=29488
 <br><br>
<b>We unfortunately will not be able to respond to any further emails on this case.</b> <br><br>
 <br><br>
Sincerely, <br><br>
The Google Team 
</blockquote>
<p>I looked immediately at the “recovered &lt;April 14&gt;” folder. A 
little over a thousand messages were there, reaching back to January of 
this year. But from the preceding six years, nothing at all. And that 
was it? “Unfortunately” they are not recoverable and Google “will not be
 able to respond to any further emails on this case”? </p>
<p>I waited until my wife got up a few hours later to rant and rave and 
yell. A company presents itself as the world’s leader in handling big 
data; it attracts users to its services (albeit free, but indispensable 
to the company as advertising vehicles) with the idea that trusting 
cloud services is <i>moderne</i>; and then it exposes them to something 
few sane users would accept on their own—the risk of “single-point 
failure” that could in a few minutes eliminate many years’ worth of 
crucial data. This is the same company famed for making every bit of 
data part of the world’s “permanent record.” That embarrassing picture 
of you in a nightclub, that subversive definition of “santorum”—they and
 other ephemera are eternal, but all your e‑mail can disappear before 
noon? </p>
<p>At this point I thought: <i>To hell with journalistic detachment</i>.
 Over the years I’d come to know lots of people at Google, and I decided
 to forward the “Unfortunately …” message to one of them. This friend 
was not Eric Schmidt, the company’s longtime CEO and now executive 
chairman, whose family my wife and I had gotten to know long before his 
Google era. (Embarrassingly enough for us, and possibly for him, he had 
received one of the “Mugged in Madrid” notes, which he passed on to me 
with a terse “Deb’s e‑mail has been hacked” subject line.) But the 
person I sent it to, Michael Jones, Google’s “Chief Technology 
Advocate,” was in a position to direct extra attention to the problem. 
My message was: You (Google) cannot be serious about this. You cannot 
entice people into relying on your services, and be so cavalier about 
the risks they are exposed to. Can you? </p>
<p>A little more than a week later, after several more warnings that 
“unfortunately” nothing might be recoverable, my wife did in fact get 
her messages back, all 4+ gigabytes. The first thing I did was to back 
them all up onto her hard disk, with Thunderbird—and then back up those 
archives elsewhere, just in case. But one of the next things I did was 
to arrange a trip to Mountain View to try to understand what had 
happened. My main discoveries exposed the gulf between the way 
information professionals understand the realities, vulnerabilities, and
 responsibilities of the cloud era and the way the rest of us do. </p>


<p>After interviews at Google with staff members ranging from the senior
 officials who set security policy to the young engineers who had 
eventually figured out how to recover maliciously deleted e‑mail 
(including my wife’s), plus follow-up interviews elsewhere, I had three 
“key takeaways,” as they say in the tech world. They involved the scale 
of the hacking problem, not just for individual users like us but for 
organizations; the nature of the arms race between people trying to 
steal or alter data and those trying to protect it; and the expectations
 of what citizens need to do to protect themselves.  </p>



<p>At Google I asked Byrant Gehring, of Gmail’s consumer-operations 
team, how often attacks occur. “Probably in the low thousands,” he said.
 “Per month?,” I asked. “No, per day,” followed by the reassurance that 
most were short-lived “hijackings,” used to send spam and phishing 
messages, and caused little or no damage, unlike our full-out attack. My
 wife and I, having heard from half a dozen friends who’d recently had 
similar problems, had innocently imagined that we all were part of some 
general upsurge in Gmail attacks. In our grandiosity, we thought it was 
perhaps even aimed at journalists. But according to the experts, while 
there are more e‑mail attacks worldwide than a year ago, it was mere 
coincidence that people we knew had been hit around the same time. On 
average, half a dozen accounts are taken over every two or three 
minutes, round the clock, including now. </p>
<p>Why are so many accounts so vulnerable? Again we were naive in the 
assumptions we’d made about our own case. We’d just returned from China,
 where everything about Internet use in general and Google services in 
particular is insecure and fraught. Had some malware made its way onto 
our computers? What about that time my wife entered her Gmail username 
and password on a public terminal at the airport in Zhuhai? Might it 
have had a keystroke logger, recording names and passwords for later 
misuse? </p>
<p>Perhaps it did, but that didn’t seem to be our problem. As in the 
great majority of hacking cases, my wife had been using the same 
password for her Gmail account as for some other, less secure sites, 
where her username was her Gmail address. (Who hasn’t done this?) And 
one way or another, a list of e‑mail addresses and associated passwords 
from one of those sites had made its way to hackers. A possible source 
was the notorious Gawker hack of 2010, when more than a million e‑mail 
addresses and matching passwords for people who had registered on Gawker
 sites were stolen. “If you have ever used the same password in more 
than one place, you have reduced your overall safety record to whichever
 site had the lowest amount of protection,” Jones told me during my 
visit. Yet this is an overwhelmingly common practice. An analysis of 
posted username/password combinations after several recent hacks showed 
that in two-thirds of the cases, if you knew a user’s password for one 
site, you knew it for another.  </p>
<p>It’s possible, too, that my wife’s password was simply “guessed,” 
though in a different way from what laymen might assume. Guessing less 
often involves social engineering—trying your birthday or your hometown 
or your relatives’ names—than “brute-force attacks,” in which a hacker’s
 computer tries every word or combination of words in existence, in a 
variety of languages, to see if it finds a match. From most officials, I
 heard reminders that if a password can be found in a dictionary, that 
password is not safe. Andrew Kovacs, communications manager for the 
Google security staff, added: “And those tricks about changing E’s to 
threes and O’s to zeros? Sorry to tell you, but the hackers have thought
 of those too.” Several of the people I spoke with pointed out that 
brute-force attacks have recently become much more effective, as hackers
 have taken advantage of the powers of new computer-graphics chips, 
which can handle certain kinds of computations even more quickly, and 
with more parallel processes running simultaneously, than a computer’s 
central processing chip can. These turn out to be the computations 
necessary for producing password hacks. </p>
<p>My wife’s password was judged as “strong” when she first chose it for
 use with Gmail. But it was a combination of two short English words 
followed by numbers, so if it didn’t leak from some other site, it might
 just have been guessed in a brute-force attack. For reasons too complex
 to explain here, even some systems, like Gmail’s, that don’t allow 
intruders to make millions of random guesses at a password can still be 
vulnerable to brute-force attacks. </p>
<p>Once her password got out, it ended up, according to later sleuthing 
by officials at Google, in the hands of someone possibly in Cote 
d’Ivoire but probably in Nigeria. My wife and I could again flatter 
ourselves that we were the objects of Chinese state security, but the 
probable truth is more mundane—“it’s like being the victims of 
pickpockets,” as Jay Nancarrow, of the Gmail team, put it. Why Nigeria? 
All of the people I spoke with had thought about this question—“I think 
about it every day,” Bryant Gehring said—and no one had a fully 
convincing answer. Their hypotheses involved some combination of talent,
 opportunity, and lack of legal controls. “They have the Internet, they 
can get rich this way, there’s not really a lot of government 
enforcement,” Gehring said. “For a lot of crafty people, it can be the 
best way to make a living.” That could apply to a lot of places, but it 
seems to be most relevant to West Africa. </p>
<p>In “The Chilling Story of Genius in a Land of Chronic Unemployment,” this past May in <i>TechCrunch</i>,
 Sarah Lacy portrayed a number of the hackers she had met in Lagos. In 
other circumstances, she said, the best of them might have been like 
Sergey Brin or Max Levchin, the immigrants who co-founded Google and 
PayPal, respectively. They were that clever and technically gifted. Or, 
more modestly, they could have been like the engineers and managers I’ve
 met over the years at Google, Microsoft, Intel, and other companies, at
 least half of whom were born and raised overseas. But these hacking 
entrepreneurs couldn’t get out of Nigeria, and so they dealt with the 
outside world via “Mugged in Madrid” messages. Shreyas Doshi, a Google 
senior project manager, said that the company had run analyses to see 
how much money the scams might produce. “With a variety of assumptions, 
we believe they could easily make about $500 a day, if not more,” he 
said; that many people fall for these scams. </p>
<p>The greatest practical fear for my wife and me was that, even if she 
eventually managed to retrieve her records, so much of our personal and 
financial data would be in someone else’s presumably hostile hands that 
we would spend our remaining years looking over our shoulders, wondering
 how and when something would be put to damaging use. At some point over
 the past six years, our correspondence would certainly have included 
every number or code that was important to us—credit-card numbers, 
bank-account information, medical info, and any other sensitive data you
 can imagine.  </p>


<p>The long siege of identity theft could still happen, and I have put 
all the credit-card companies on alert. But a few months into our 
post-hacking life, we’ve seen no indication of trouble, and according to
 the Google officials, the hacker would depart from past patterns if he 
began using the data in the way we most feared. “We haven’t had a major 
incident with credit-card [numbers obtained from scanning Gmail] yet,” 
Bryant Gehring said. The economics of hacking are constantly changing, 
so we are still on guard. But security officials at Google and elsewhere
 said that for talented hackers in Lagos or Abidjan, it is generally 
safer and more rewarding to collect money at Western Union, which can be
 done virtually untraceably, as opposed to poring through e‑mail 
archives in search of data to create identity-theft schemes. Why, then, 
did the hacker bother to erase all the archives? “Because he—or she—was a
 good hacker,” Gehring said. “He wanted to make it harder for you to get
 in touch with all your contacts and warn them not to send money to 
Madrid. You remember their names but probably not all their e‑mail 
addresses.” Many e-mail hackings, whether on Gmail or another major 
system, involve deletion of mail that arrives after the hijacking; only a
 destructive minority involve a complete zeroing-out of the archives 
like what happened to my wife. </p>



<p>Against this assault, the Google security team, like its counterparts
 at other companies, is constantly monitoring activity across its 
systems, toward the end of detecting break-ins and hijacks before damage
 has been done, and even before the owners know that something has gone 
wrong. The signs they’re looking for have endlessly evolved: this year’s
 “Mugged in Madrid” message was last year’s “Mugged in London,” with 
enough minor changes to avoid many filters. “Google is a very 
data-centric place,” Eric Grosse, Google’s head of security, said to me.
 “We log lots of things and constantly have computers crunching over 
this data, trying to look for subtle patterns and keep up with the 
continual changes. That lets us do a better job of spam filtering than 
you could do on your own machine, since we see so much of it. We try to 
use the same techniques to look for other signs of abuse.” Jay 
Nancarrow, of Google’s communications team, added: “A lot of the signals
 we analyze are evident only because we’re offering the service to so 
many people. This is the kind of machine-learning the cloud enables that
 is very hard otherwise.” </p>

<p>I kept asking for examples of such tells; perhaps reassuringly, the 
Google officials kept saying they would rather not get into details. 
“But suppose we see that all your friends start marking mail from your 
account as spam,” Shreyas Doshi said. Obviously he didn’t mean that any 
human being at Google is monitoring your correspondence. Rather, its 
systems, like those of other companies that handle large numbers of 
online accounts, are constantly searching for anomalies. “Or if suddenly
 the recovery phone number in your account is changed to a number in 
South Africa. Or if you suddenly delete 20,000 e‑mails at once.” Any of 
these would be a sign that something might be going wrong, which Google 
would use to automatically immobilize the account. Indeed, the deletion 
of tens of thousands of e‑mails at once is what happened to my wife—and 
according to Gehring, the monitoring system had already noted an anomaly
 and was beginning to freeze the account by the time we filed our first 
report. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most startling thing I learned at Google about my wife’s 
case was how “lucky” we had been. Lucky not in having friends we could 
turn to in the otherwise automated and unapproachable Google 
edifice—though, of course, we were—but simply in the timing of the 
attack. If this had happened six months or a year earlier, or if it 
happened even today at most other e-mail services,<b> </b>the archives 
would likely have been gone forever. It was only because of the 
Undeletion Project that recovery, although slow, was feasible at all. </p>
<p>How could this be? How could big tech companies offer cloud services 
to hundreds of millions of people without better guarding their data 
against catastrophic loss? On Google’s side, one explanation involved 
complexities of the law. My wife and I might think that Google had a 
“duty” to be able to find her messages after some hacker had erased 
them. But according to Google’s legal department, its higher and more 
stringent duty is to ensure that messages are <i>erased</i>, if whoever 
is in charge of an account wants them gone. Political activists in 
repressive countries, people who for whatever reason (@RepWeiner) want 
parts of their electronic correspondence to disappear—they are the ones 
Google, like other e‑mail providers, had in mind in designing a system 
optimized for deletion rather than recovery. In exceptional cases, 
mainly in response to government orders in criminal or anti-terrorism 
investigations, Google could laboriously piece together already deleted 
records from its tape backups. But such recovery efforts were slow, 
hand-crafted undertakings, impractical for responding to thousands of 
hacking episodes a day (only some of which lead to total erasures). </p>
<p><span style="text-transform: uppercase;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">“Every year, we do</span> an
 immersion session with people involved in consumer operations,” I was 
told by Birendro Roy, one of the two young engineers at Google who 
developed the software for the Undeletion Project. He and his colleague 
Jaishankar Sundararaman were introduced to me as “the people who 
actually restored your wife’s mail.” (Roy, whose father is from India 
and mother is from Finland, grew up in Baton Rouge and went to MIT. 
Sundararaman grew up and went to college in Tamil Nadu, in southern 
India, and then did graduate work at Virginia Tech. I mention this as 
part of my ongoing chronicle of America’s strength through attracting 
foreign talent.) “The consumer reps tell us what are the common user 
‘pain points,’ and restoring mail had definitely been something users 
were requesting.”  </p>
<p>What a surprise, that people would want to recover from catastrophe! 
But from Google’s engineering perspective, the deleted-mail problem, 
while dire for those confronting it, affected only a tiny fraction of 
their users, and also was more complicated to solve than some other 
mainstream usability issues. In companies like Google, relatively few 
innovations are the result of top-down orders from executives. More 
evolve bottom-up, as engineers and product managers become sold on the 
need to add a new product or feature to the company’s offerings. 
Sometime last year, the Gmail engineers became sold on the value of a 
recovery system for maliciously deleted e‑mail. My wife’s luck was that 
her hack occurred this year rather than last—“Before, users were pretty 
much out of luck,” Bryant Gehring said—and that it hit the debugging 
cycle just when it did. To streamline a long story, the Undeletion 
Project software still had an important bug at the time of our first 
complaint. When the recovery software reached a message of a certain 
sort (“it was a ‘corner case’ involving saved drafts,” Sundararaman 
said), it mistakenly concluded that it had gotten to the end of the 
e‑mail list and could find nothing more. The engineers discovered the 
bug at just the time I was launching my “You cannot be serious!” screeds
 from outside. So now, if you lose your e-mail and start the recovery in
 time (deleted e-mail stays in a theoretically recoverable limbo for as 
long as 30 days, after which it’s likely gone for good), you should be 
able to get it back. In September, Google began offering a live help 
line for e-mail recovery, at a small cost (to deter abuse) of a few 
dollars. </p>
<p>“Of course, the very best way to recover data is not to lose it in 
the first place,” Shreyas Doshi said, in outlining what he described as a
 three-tier philosophy of data protection that was shared by Google, 
Yahoo, and other “cloud” companies. But that won’t help people like Deb 
when they make their horrifying discoveries. So Doshi outlined a tiered 
strategy I endorse for anyone who runs or uses e‑mail or Internet 
services—which is to say, everybody.  </p>
<p>The first tier is for companies to give users a more realistic view 
of where and why they might be vulnerable, so they can do more to 
protect themselves. The second is for companies to reduce the incentive 
toward Internet crime by making it less profitable for the 
perpetrators—for instance, with better, faster ways of detecting 
hijackings, so that accounts will automatically be closed, even before 
the first “Mugged in Madrid” spam goes out. (And it seems that someone 
might usefully have a word with Western Union too.) The third is for 
companies to create better recovery systems, like the Undeletion 
Project, for when steps one and two fail.  </p>
<p><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Discussion of the cyber-threat</span>
 menace has become a boom industry on its own. My latest immersion in 
the topic has left me more consoled than I might have 
expected—especially when I was imagining, early on, what the intrusion 
on my own household might mean to everyone else on the Internet who 
might innocently have exposed un‑backed‑up data to similar risk. </p>
<p>True, there is a lot to be worried about. “We have not examined a 
[corporate or governmental] network yet in which we have not discovered 
some level of intrusion,” Ron Ritchey, a longtime security expert now 
working at Booz Allen, told me. And “these things have been going on for
 years and years,” his colleague Ken Silva, the NSA veteran, said. “But 
companies are only now beginning to talk about them. After the Google 
report”—not about low-level cases like ours but about the massive 
Chinese intrusion on Google’s internal systems that the company revealed
 early last year—“the landscape for reporting these events really 
changed.” Both experts said the potential threat that concerned them 
most was not data theft or data loss, especially as it affected 
individual users, but data alteration that could affect institutions. 
“Imagine what could happen to the financial system, if trading data were
 altered,” Silva said. (Imagine: people might not trust financiers!) Or 
the medical data in a hospital. Or the formulas and data in spreadsheets
 on which companies base their bids and negotiations.  </p>
<p>But on the other side, between us and data chaos are potentially 
protective factors of scale, technology, and strategy. Scale, in that 
big companies can invest big resources in monitoring and protecting 
their and their customers’ data. My money should be harder to steal if 
it’s in the bank than if it’s in my pocket, and something similar should
 be true of data. Technology, in that every person I spoke with 
emphasized that we’re living through an awkward stage in our current 
reliance on passwords. “Good passwords are bad for people, and bad 
passwords are good for criminals,” Michael Jones of Google said. Sooner 
or later, a better, easier, more reliable system of verifying identity 
will become widespread. It could be “biometric”—thumbprint recognition, 
iris scans, even a match of your face’s image, as you sit in front of 
the computer’s camera, with a stored picture of you. It could be purely 
digital, like Google’s recently introduced “two-step verification” 
system for Gmail identity, in which users enter both their password and a
 special code sent by Google to their cell phone or mobile device. None 
of these is perfect, but each one is a big advance over security now. </p>
<p>And strategy, in the form of a corporate and governmental emphasis on
 “data hardening” to limit the resulting loss when some attack 
inevitably succeeds. No free society can completely eliminate loss from 
crime, accidental death or destruction, even terrorism. The sane 
strategy is to prepare to contain the damage if and when things go 
wrong. Airbags in cars, watertight compartments in ships, hardened 
cockpit doors in airliners—these all illustrate the approach. The scary 
part in my wife’s case was that failure in one place meant potential 
failure of the system as a whole. Because she had used her password in 
one vulnerable place, all of the electronic data that mattered to her 
was at risk. If the data-hardening principle got through to me in the 
course of interviews, it has certainly occurred to security 
professionals at the institutions that collectively make up our new 
cloud info-system. </p>
<p icap="on">W<span style="text-transform: uppercase;">hat about the </span>rest
 of us, who are not security professionals? I asked that of every person
 I interviewed. Many of their recommendations boiled down to the hope 
that people would <i>think</i> more about their life online. “We’d like 
people to view their information life the way they view other parts of 
their life,” Andrew Kovacs of Google said. “It’s a good practice to 
review your financial situation every so often, and it’s a good practice
 to review your passwords and online-account information too.” Another 
official compared “cloud hygiene” to personal hygiene: you feel bad if 
you don’t brush your teeth or take a shower, and you should learn to 
feel bad if you’re taking risks online. </p>
<p>In practical terms, I have three action points I preach to anyone who will listen. Really, only two and a half. </p>
<p>The half step is extremely important, but I count it only as a half 
because it applies specifically to users of Gmail rather than other 
online systems. Here it is: if you use Gmail, <i>please</i> use Google’s
 new “two-step verification” system. In practice this means that to log 
into your account from any place other than your own computer, you have 
to enter an additional code, from Google, shown on your mobile phone. On
 your own computer, you enter a code only once every 30 days. This is 
not an airtight solution, but it can thwart nearly all of the remote 
attacks that affect Gmail thousands of times a day. Even though the 
hacker in Lagos has your password, if he doesn’t have your cell phone, 
he can’t get in. </p>
<p>In case you’ve missed the point: if you use Gmail, use this system. 
Also, make sure the recovery information for your account—a backup 
e-mail address or cell phone where you can receive password-reset 
information—is current. Google uses these to verify that you are the 
real owner. </p>
<p>Next we have password selection, that seemingly impossible task. The 
science, psychology, and sociology of creating strong passwords is a 
surprisingly well-chronicled and fascinating field. On <i>The Atlantic</i>’s
 Web site, we will describe some of the main strategies and the 
reasoning behind them. Even security professionals recognize the 
contradiction: the stronger the password, the less likely you are to 
remember it. Thus the Post-it notes with passwords, on monitor screens 
or in desk drawers. </p>
<p>But there is a middle ground, of passwords strong enough to create 
problems for hackers and still simple enough to be manageable. There are
 more details on our site, but strategies include: </p>
<p>
 • Choose a long, familiar-to-you sequence of ordinary words, with 
spaces between them as in an ordinary sentence, which more and more 
sites now allow. “Lake Winnebago is deep and chilly,” for instance. Or 
“my favorite packer is not brett favre.” You could remember a phrase 
like that, but a hacker’s computer, which couldn’t tell spaces from 
characters, would see only one forbiddingly long password sequence. <br><br>
  • Choose a shorter sequence of words that are not “real” English 
words. I once lived in a Ghanaian village called Assin Fosu. I can 
remember its name easily, but it would be hard to guess. Even harder if I
 added numbers or characters.<br><br>
  • Choose a truly obscure, gibberish password—“V*!amYEg5M5!3R” is one I
 generated just now with the LastPass system, and you’re welcome to 
it—and then find a way to store it. Having it written down in your 
wallet is one, though the paper it’s on shouldn’t say “Passwords” at the
 top. The approach I prefer, and use for some passwords, is to entrust 
them to online managers like LastPass or RoboForm. Even if their 
corporate sites were hacked, that wouldn’t reveal all your passwords, 
since the programs work by storing part of the encoding information in 
the cloud and part on your own machine. 
</p>
<p>At a minimum, any step up from “password,” “123456,” or your own birthday is worthwhile. </p>
<p>Finally, use <i>different</i> passwords. Not hundreds of different 
ones, for the hundreds of different places that require logins of some 
kind. The guide should be: <i>any site that matters needs its own password</i>—one you don’t currently use for any other site, and that you have never used anywhere else.  </p>
<p>“Using an important password anywhere else is just like mailing your 
house key to anyone who might be making a delivery,” Michael Jones of 
Google said. “If you use your password in two places, it is not a valid 
password.” </p>
<p>I asked my experts how many passwords they personally used. The 
highest I heard was “about a dozen.” The lowest was four, and the norm 
was five or six. They all stressed that they managed their passwords and
 sites in different categories. In my own case, there are five sites 
whose security really matters to me: my main e‑mail account, two 
credit-card sites, a banking account, and an investment firm. Each has 
its own, good password, never used anywhere else. Next are the sites I’d
 just as soon not have compromised: airline-mileage accounts, Amazon and
 Barnes &amp; Noble, various message boards and memberships. I have two 
or three semi-strong passwords I use among all of them. If you hacked 
one of them you might hack the others, but I don’t really care. Then 
there is everything else, the thicket of annoying little logins we all 
deal with. I have one or two passwords for them too. By making it easy 
to deal with unimportant accounts, I can concentrate on protecting the 
ones that matter.  </p>
<p><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">At the end of my visit </span>to
 Google, I went by to see Michael Jones, the friend to whom I’d first 
turned in data-loss despair. I told him what I’d learned, and how I 
would try to spread the message of shared responsibility, individual and
 organizational, for security in the cloud age. </p>
<p>“I see that you’ve got it!” he said. “The zeal of the convert. People
 in the business think about the risks all the time, but normal people 
don’t, until they’ve gotten a taste of the consequences of failure.”  </p>
<p>I have now had that taste and am here to share the experience. As 
with so many other challenges in modern life, responding with panic or 
zealotry doesn’t get us anywhere. But a few simple self-protective steps
 can save a lot of heartache later on.  </p>
