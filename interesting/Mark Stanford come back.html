PLEASANT, S.C.&#8211;When people recognize Mark Sanford&#8212;this happens
extraordinarily often in South Carolina&#8212;he notices. He notices the
contractor waiting in his car, or the woman shopping for lettuce, or
the student who looks up from his phone with an<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><span>oh-it&#8217;s-that-guy</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>expression.
At a tire store in this Charleston suburb, part of the 1st
Congressional District that Sanford wants to represent, he makes the
circuit of a waiting room, issuing his icebreaker again and again.=</p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p class="">&#8220;Can I be rude,&#8221; he asks, &#8220;and say hello?&#8221;</p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p class="">When
a voter lifts a camera phone to take a photo, Sanford knows, and he
spins around to take charge. &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to take a picture,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;can I be in it?&#8221; If this person is merely a gawker, visiting
from Florida or Illinois, Sanford smiles and hands over his business
card&#8212;&#8220;if you have any family in the district, they can call me.&#8221; If he
might know one of Sanford&#8217;s sons, the candidate whips out his white
iPhone and calls his son for an impromptu chat. If the person makes a
joke, Sanford bends his knees and guffaws at the funniest thing he&#8217;s
ever heard.<br></p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p class="">This
was how Sanford spent the final weekend of his campaign for Congress, a
meet-cute scene repeated ad infinitum across the district. He&#8217;s<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/sanford-announced-run-for-congress-86271.html" style="cursor: inherit; color: black;">done this for nearly five months</a>,
and it&#8217;s gotten easier&#8212;instant public affirmation and forgiveness for
his trespasses in real time. To win back the congressional seat he held
in the 1990s, to be a distinguished gentleman who can once again decry
the federal debt and the welfare state, he must single-handedly win
over the people who&#8212;let&#8217;s be honest&#8212;don&#8217;t want to elect a Democrat
unless they&#8217;re desperate. So he keeps talking.</p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p class="">&#8220;It&#8217;s
a blessing,&#8221; said Sanford on Saturday, as he walked his home turf in
Beaufort, S.C. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been to a place in life wherein people didn&#8217;t want
to get pictures of me. It was a very quiet spot. I spent a year on our
family farm in northern Beaufort county, which is half an hour up the
road&#8212;a quite incredibly introspective year.&#8221;<br></p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p>Beaufort had been taken over in celebration of Candice Glover, an<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><span>American Idol</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>contestant
who&#8217;d made it to the final three, thus earning a taped-for-TV parade
and concert. Sanford adapted immediately, posing next to a pro-Candice
T-Shirt (&#8220;The Low Country&#8217;s Idol&#8221;) and greeting people with a chipper
&#8220;Happy Candice Day!&#8221; Sanford never appreciated the
grip-and-grab-and-grip-some-more side of politics until he&#8217;d walked
away from it all on the &#8220;Appalachian Trail.&#8221;</p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p>&#8220;If
you&#8217;ve been in politics,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you have people who want to take
their picture with you, but it was very different. I love people, I&#8217;ve
always loved people, but it was the kind of thing you had to do.&#8221; But
now: &#8220;I was at a thing with my boys. We were trying to get into a
football game. It was one of those things where it was incredibly
elongated by people who wanted to take pictures.&#8221; Sanford grins at the
memory of his bored, irritated kids. &#8220;I said guys, you don&#8217;t get it.
This is an incredible blessing.&#8221;</p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p>Many voters here&#8212;most of them, possibly&#8212;are in the mood to bless him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/11/19/1163009/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-the-2012-2008-elections?detail=hide" style="cursor: inherit; color: black;">Mitt Romney won</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>this
district by 18 points, but that might even undersell how Republican it
is because African-Americans who voted for Barack Obama are harder to
turn out in any special election.</p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p>Elizabeth Colbert Busch, inevitably referred to in national news as &#8220;the sister of TV comedian Stephen Colbert,&#8221; is<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.clemson.edu/media-relations/archive/newsroom/articles/2008/february/Elizabeth_Colbert_Busch.php5" style="cursor: inherit; color: black;">a business development guru</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>who&#8217;d
once donated to Sanford. If you&#8217;re ashamed of Sanford, she&#8217;s your
tolerable alternative. Her radio ad played incessantly on conservative
talk radio chides Sanford for voting against dredging the port of
Charleston because&#8230; well, you know.</p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p><span>Mark Sanford had a better use for our tax dollars. He used taxpayer money to be with his mistress in Argentina.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br></p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p>Colbert
Busch said this to Sanford&#8217;s face, almost&#8212;in their sole debate she
reminded everyone that his Argentina trip was &#8220;personal.&#8221; Nobody else
will get in his face about it, not even after his ex-wife Jenny filed a
trespassing complaint against him, not even after voters learned
Sanford would have to be in court two days after the election. When an
NBC producer asked him about this, Sanford<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/katenocera/voters-shrug-off-sanfords-past" style="cursor: inherit; color: black;">walked from female voter to female voter</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>to "try to find a woman who doesn't like me.&#8221; When I caught up to him in Beaufort, he was still bristling.</p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p>&#8220;The NBC gal who was with us earlier,&#8221; he said, &#8220;she&#8212;&#8221;<br></p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p>Sanford
was cut short, because a real-life female voter was interrupting him,
asking for a photo. For three minutes I waited as Sanford posed and
small-talked and posed some more. Eleven different groups of people,
mostly women, took home Sanford snapshots. The only dissonance came
from a woman who quickly ruined the picture by making &#8220;bunny ears&#8221; over
Sanford&#8217;s head and sprinting away.</p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p>&#8220;The
NBC affiliate comes down from Washington,&#8221; said Sanford, finally, &#8220;and
their angle is, you know&#8212;you&#8217;ve got a woman problem. I say&#8212;What? Come
with me. Come with me for the day.&#8221; He laughed as he walked over to
meet some soldiers walking around Beaufort in fatigues. &#8220;The national
media decide what their story is.&#8221;<br></p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p>The
real story, as designed by the Sanford campaign, is this: Minority
Leader Nancy Pelosi is trying to buy the seat. Colbert Busch&#8217;s affable
promise to work with both sides is a cover story. The message is
scrawled on wooden planks that dot the roads from Charleston to
Beaufort, in black spray paint&#8212;&#8220;Sanford Saves Tax $&#8221; and &#8220;Sanford:
Boeing = Jobs&#8221; and &#8220;Say No to Pelosi&#8217;s $1 Million.&#8221; At Molly Darcy&#8217;s, a
Charleston bar where Sanford volunteers congregate after work, the
first sign is leaned against a fence, partially obscured, making it
read simply, religiously, &#8220;Sanford Saves.&#8221; The handwriting is as about
as crisp as the ones held by cows on those Chick-fil-A &#8220;Eat Mor Chikin&#8221;
ads. They&#8217;re supposed to recast the Sanford campaign as a grass-roots
crusade, and they work.</p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p>&#8220;We
gotta stop Pelosi,&#8221; said Wayne Baker, a retired propane salesman, when
he got his chance to meet Sanford in Beaufort. &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ve been through
a divorce. Sometimes it works, sometimes it don&#8217;t. If it don&#8217;t, you
move on, you make yourself a better person. He did his thing. He didn&#8217;t
hide it&#8212;he came out in public. The way he did that, I think people got
more trust in him.&#8221;</p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p>Baker
looks at my notebook and tape recorder. &#8220;You&#8217;re in the media, so I&#8217;m
gonna say some things. Do you know why some of the best people don&#8217;t
run? They got a background. They got stones in the backyard you can dig
up. But he&#8217;s already<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><span>come out</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>with his girlfriend. You can<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><span>respect</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>that.&#8221;<br></p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p>Sanford
ended his Beaufort trip on the third floor of an office building, on a
pleasant porch overlooking the Candice Glover parade. A Republican
donor, who keeps intermittently forgetting that I&#8217;m a reporter and
thanking me for &#8220;everything you&#8217;re doing for the governor,&#8221; whips out
an iPhone and shows me the sort of thing that&#8217;s &#8220;winning this thing in
social media.&#8221; It&#8217;s just a picture of Nancy Pelosi in Joker makeup.
Sanford hangs onto every fiber connecting Colbert Busch to national
Democrats, from her<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/347491/colbert-buschs-union-push" style="cursor: inherit; color: black;">union support</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>to
the donations coming in through the progressive online donation
bundling site, ActBlue. &#8220;Somebody told me that Elizabeth Warren, in her
race, received half of her funding from ActBlue,&#8221; Sanford informs
reporters on Monday. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s true or not, I just heard
it.&#8221; The point: &#8220;Be wherever you are. Don&#8217;t be stealthy.&#8221;</p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p class="">In other states and campaigns, Democrats like Colbert Busch have threaded the needle. They&#8217;re not like those<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><span>other</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Democrats,
the liberals, the ones you can&#8217;t trust. Colbert Busch attempts to do
this by inserting some reference to business experience in whichever
part of the sentence it may be grammatical. Sanford&#8217;s omnipresent radio
ad hits the Democrat for theoretically favoring &#8220;Obamacare, economic
stimulus, raising the debt ceiling.&#8221; That&#8217;s the kind of district this
is&#8212;a place where being willing to raise the debt ceiling is a threat to
decent people. On Monday, after she finishes a friendly visit to a
black barbershop in the north Charleston suburbs, I ask Colbert Busch
under what circumstances she&#8217;d raise the thing.</p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p class="">&#8220;I&#8217;m
a businesswoman, OK?&#8221; she says. &#8220;Twenty-five years. Before you do
anything, before you make any changes, you go in&#8212;it&#8217;s very basic,
here&#8217;s my operations cost, here&#8217;s how much revenue I can bring in. If
my costs are too high, I have too much waste, I&#8217;m doing duplicative
work, I need to address this first. Until that gets addressed you can&#8217;t
deal with anything else.&#8221; Does that mean no debt ceiling hike without
spending cuts? Colbert Busch holds up her hands, as if she&#8217;s weighing
bushels on a scale. &#8220;You have to get your cost under control, right?
You have to get your fiscal house in order. At the same time you&#8217;re
cutting your waste, you&#8217;re watching your spending, you prioritize your
dollars over&#8221;&#8212;left hand&#8212;&#8220;here. What happens when you&#8217;re prioritizing
your investment? You bring this&#8221;&#8212;right hand&#8212;&#8220;under control.&#8221;</p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p class="">Sanford&#8217;s answer is simpler: He<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/337753/mark-sanford-i-m-running-congress-jim-geraghty" style="cursor: inherit; color: black;">doesn&#8217;t want to raise it</a>.
On Monday, he stumps in more random, friendly locations with
Republicans who&#8217;ve endorsed him. At a diner, former Gov. James Edwards
warns that a loss here might lead to the loss of the Republican House,
which would let President Obama become &#8220;a dictator.&#8221; State Rep. Chip
Limehouse, one of the Republicans who lost the primary to Sanford, nods
along.</p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p class="">&#8220;It&#8217;s a battle for the soul of the country,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If we lose the House, we&#8217;ll lose America.&#8221;</p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p class="">&nbsp;&#8220;Then it&#8217;s all over,&#8221; says Edwards.</p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p class="">Nearby,
Sanford stands in front of TV cameras and talks about the polling that
shows him, finally, inching ahead of Colbert Busch. People made fun of
him when he &#8220;debated&#8221; a cardboard<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/mark-sanford-debate-cardboard-nancy-pelosi-90572.html" style="cursor: inherit; color: black;">cut-out of Nancy Pelosi</a>. But had it worked?</p></div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content"><p class="">&nbsp;&#8220;You know,&#8221; says Sanford, grinning, &#8220;a lot of my friends in the local media circles said I actually won that debate.&#8221;</p></div></div><div><div class="cpf-printOut-body-content">MySlate
