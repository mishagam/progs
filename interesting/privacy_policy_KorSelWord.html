<h1>Privacy policy for KoreanSelectWord Android application.</h1>
<p>For now we have not implemented any network functionality in KoreanSelectWord application, 
so we don't and are unable to collect any user data. As a result, our application doesn't represent privacy threat.</p> 
<p>If and when we decide to add network functionality to this application we will put updated privacy policy document here. </p>
