                <p data-line-id="90655affecc44ce381a76dced913c7c2">LONDON – The horrendous attack by a French-Tunisian man on a crowd in Nice celebrating Bastille Day, which killed 84 and injured hundreds more, will give National Front leader Marine Le Pen a massive boost in next spring’s presidential election. It doesn’t matter whether the murderer, Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, had any links to radical Islamism. Throughout the Western world, a toxic mix of physical, economic, and cultural insecurity has been fueling anti-immigration sentiment and politics precisely at the moment when the disintegration of post-colonial states across the Islamic crescent is producing a <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/getting-a-grip-on-migration-by-mark-leonard-2016-06">refugee problem</a> on a scale not seen since World War II.
</p>
<p data-line-id="65d462970d0d441eadbf5b4ad17155f4">In the last 30 years or so, a key benchmark for liberal-democratic societies has been their openness to newcomers. Only bigots could not see that immigration benefits both hosts and migrants; so the task of political leadership was to keep such views out of the dominant discourse, and to facilitate integration or assimilation. Unfortunately, most Western elites failed to appreciate the conditions of success.

<p data-line-id="82ec30eef5884841984d645f9ed857b2">Although the movement of peoples has been a constant feature of human history, it has been relatively bloodless only when it was into scantily settled or developing territories. A classic case was the nineteenth-century emigrations from Europe to the New World. Between 1840 and 1914, 55 million people left Europe for the Americas – much larger, relative to population, than migration since WWII. Nearly all the movers were economic migrants, pushed out of their countries by famine and agricultural depression and pulled to the New World by the promise of free land and a better life.
</p>
<p data-line-id="4607e79971ba433db1d133ccf6584b72">As the world industrialized and filled up with people, the flow of people from developed to developing areas reversed. Poverty and starvation still pushed migrants off the land in poor countries; now, however, the pull factor was not free land, but better jobs in developed countries.
</p>
<p data-line-id="5a09be08a607453d8f77bc1ca5cffba8">This set up today’s tension. After WWII, Western governments devised policies that aimed to balance the economic benefits of immigration (cheap labor) with protection of domestic jobs and ways of life. For example, between 1955 and 1973, West Germany admitted 14 million “guest workers,” largely from Turkey. But, though the guests were expected to return home after two years, these controls gradually weakened as part of the general movement toward free trade and free capital movements.
</p>
<p data-line-id="423451b265944722b6d489894bbef460">Alongside economic motives for migration there has always been another: ethnic, religious, and political persecution. Examples include the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, of Huguenots from France in 1685, of Germans and others from Eastern Europe following WWII, of some Palestinians from Israel in 1948, and of Indians from Uganda in the 1970s.
</p>
<p data-line-id="833eb92a64b54729b93574c1b1b18f18">In recent years, refugees have mainly been fleeing either persecution or extreme insecurity following state disintegration. We saw this in the Balkans in the 1990s, and in Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa in the 2000s. The five million Syrians now in Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan are the latest and most dramatic example of this pattern.
</p>
<p data-line-id="abd625e52d184c2099fc4afdb360d34b">For this class of migrant, push factors are by far the most important. But the line between refugees and economic migrants blurs over time. History indicates that most refugees do not return to their country of origin. It takes too long for the feeling of extreme insecurity to subside; and, meanwhile, the lure of a better life takes hold.
</p>
<p data-line-id="d8ab8c3188b9428f829885aa46db1de6">This explains an important fact about popular perception: most people in the host countries do not distinguish between economic migrants and refugees. Both are typically viewed as claimants on existing resources, not as creators of new resources. The flight of East Asians from Kenya during that country’s “Africanization” campaign led directly to the UK’s anti-immigration legislation of 1968.
</p>
<p data-line-id="43140d7a76774bc896350a99927f79a6">This historical perspective suggests three conclusions. First, anti-immigrant sentiment is not based only on prejudice, ignorance, or political opportunism. Anti-immigrant language is not just socially constructed. Words are not mirrors of things “out there,” but they have some relation to such things. You cannot manipulate something unless there is something to manipulate. We have little chance of changing the words unless we alter the realities to which they refer.
</p>
<p data-line-id="79d332c351844763944b6b0e3bd3a3c0">Second, the era of unregulated mass population movement is drawing to a close. As the Brexit vote shows, Europe’s political class greatly underestimated the strains caused by free mobility across borders – a shibboleth of the failed neoliberal project of maximizing market-based resource allocation. Critics of neoliberalism cannot consistently exempt population movements from regulation. Indeed, the fatal flaw of free mobility in the EU is that it always presupposed a state to manage the movement. This state does not exist. Giving people an EU passport doesn’t legitimize a single labor market, which is why “emergency brakes” on migration within the EU are inevitable.
</p>
<p data-line-id="ffd608e6a38b4ae9bad3bb4d1b497bdb">Third, we need to accept the fact that most of the refugees arriving in the EU will not return home.
</p>
<p data-line-id="32bb371a950d43648b675a66f414c605">The way forward is difficult. The easiest steps are those that increase voters’ security, in the widest sense, because such policies are within the control of political leaders. These measures will include not just a cap on the number of economic migrants, but also policies leading to expectation of full employment and continuity of income. Only if voters’ economic insecurity is diminished is there any hope for active policies to assimilate or integrate refugees, whose numbers Western leaders cannot directly control.
</p>
<p data-line-id="d0d7fe95a66f43f6ba59600cfeeb1c26">The unsolved problem is how to reduce those factors pushing people out of their own countries.

<p data-line-id="29858f8cfa8e41cfbe77aa9695714e6a">We may hope that economic development in Eastern Europe – or Mexico – will equalize conditions sufficiently to end net flows from one region to another; but ending the flow of refugees from the Middle East and Africa is altogether more daunting. Restoration of order and creation of legitimate authority are preconditions of economic development, and we don’t know how this is to be done. In some cases, it may require redrawing borders. But it is hard to see that happening without years of fighting, or to know how the West can reduce the bloodshed.
</p>
<p data-line-id="da38605a23774661a4bc498d361e727c">One thing seems certain to me: without increased security at both ends, political violence will spill over from the Islamic world to its nearest neighbors in Europe.

                When the speed and scale of migrations outweigh the quantifiable benefits it becomes destabilizing as ethnicities do not blend well at scale. Greater balance in immigration is needed as well, having 20-30 unquantified and documented million Mexican and central Americans flowing into the USA has caused unease in many places and wage suppression for all workers.<br/>Policy has been less than adequate and thoughtful.<br/><br/>Europe is now being invaded by militant young men, and in time, it will be realized that it is indeed an invasion, and it will be too late to avoid the yet to come hyperbolic increase in militant Islamic violence. This will not end well and assistance policy for refugees must be focused on helping in their respective countries. Globalization in the end is nothing more than the obsessive exploitation of labor, which is not a form of humane behavior.<br/><br/>A major re-think of capitalism/globalization is needed as it really only works well with massive population growth, and that period for the planet has ended and the end of &quot;workism&quot; has begun. <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                Only bigots...and maybe people on low incomes looking for a house, and maybe people who can&#39;t get their kids into a local school and people who can&#39;t get an appointment to see their doctor or who have to wait longer for a referral to a hospital to see a consultant or someone in a low paid job who&#39;s seen a shift in the supply curve to the right hand side stuffing their chance of a wage rise. <br/>What made our society a success during the period the French call Les Trente Glorieuses?<br/>For thirty years the people who won the war with a spirit of national unity built homes. They built the things we used in those homes and the cars we parked outside them. In Scotland on the initiative of Tom Johnston we built hydro schemes, providing well paid jobs, to supply low cost power to everyone. We were all in this together. The rising tide lifted all boats. <br/>Since then we have lost our way entirely. A series of expensive and catastrophic wars were socially fragmentory for the lucky recipients of our military largesse. We had to destroy Iraq and Syria and Libya in order to save them. Perhaps a million people in Iraq have either died directly from military or terrorist actions or from the collapse of medical care which followed their social disintegration. If some of the people arriving as refugees in Europe carry some malice towards the west perhaps that is unsurprising.<br/>Continuing the war in Syria is insane. It could be ended if the west would allow Assad to remain in power at least in part of the country, including some coast for the Russian&#39;s only naval base in the Mediterranean. We won&#39;t allow this as it smells of defeat. So we continue supporting our &quot;freedom fighters&quot; against Assad and Daesh while Daesh fight the Kurds and Assad and Assad fights the Kurds and our &quot;freedom fighters&quot; and Daesh. Death continues to rain down on the innocent civilians. More death benefits no-one. Until we provide a route to a safe homecoming for all the refugees the world will not return to peace, not there, not here, not now and not ever.  <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                For some time now I have been reading the Open Borders propaganda about “trillion dollar bills lying on the sidewalk” (the alleged benefits of Open Borders). I have always wondered “Which sidewalk?” and what does a “trillion dollar bill” really look like?<br/><br/>Now we know. The sidewalk is the Promenade des Anglais in Nice. The “trillion dollar bills” have been cleverly disguised as baby carriages. <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                Brexit was the first major &quot;push back&quot; on open borders - many in the EU would also vote to restrict incomers, but most countries have been denied the possibility to have their views heard, as a consequence a negative underlying resentment to foreigners; political elites and government in general is rising, which if not properly dealt with could erupt into serious societal disorder.<br/><br/>The French insistence that the UK must continue to allow open borders to trade with Europe is a further &quot;pathetic&quot; denial of reality.  The UK long mocked for asking for so called &quot;special treatment&quot; is actually a very special case whose reasonable requests are ignored at the EU&#39;s peril.<br/><br/>The UK has probably the most welcoming liberal attitude to incomers and what happens in the UK is a bell weather for the rest of Europe.  If the British people have said we cannot continue with an open door you had better believe them and also accept that if the EU&#39;s most tolerant country begins to turn against incomers the future for the rest of the EU will become bleak indeed.  Any pretence to wanting to &quot;punish&quot; the UK for uttering the unutterable ...migration isn&#39;t working , will increase the temperature across the continent and massive shifts in voter opinion could see a number of mainstream governments overthrown and hardline right wing parties brought to power - these are very very real risks and the clock is ticking.<br/><br/>If politicians are sensible, they will hold teir hands up and accept that the experiement with mass free movement has run its course.  Countries who are over burdened will have the ability to regulate the numbers and a simple method of doing this (and allowing the rule to apply to everyone in the EEA/EU) is to set a limit of per square kilometre population and where countries are deemed to be  &quot;highly populated&quot; say over 250 people per square kilometre then different rules for settlement can be used.  This would relieved the pressure on countries like Holland; Channel Islands and the UK and others who are reaching over population.  <br/><br/>The Failure of the EU to allow countries with very specific pressure points to have systems to deal with them was a direct cause of Brexit.  Added to the failure to manage over population has been a blindness to the dangers of &quot;multiculturalism&quot;.  In many countries this has been seen by incoming migrants as a carte blanche to behave as if they had never left the country they had migrated from.  The failure to meld with the new host country; the failure to mix with mainstream society; the failure to learn the language of the new country; the failure to respect the values and beliefs of the host country; the propensity to complain and emonstrate if the host country does not accommodate the very specific requirements of incoming failth groups and ethnic groups; and the general blindness tby the EU to the very real strains that lack of integration has caused, in the creation of urban ghettoes; or even rural enclaves that live parallel lives to mainstream society creating alienated incomers and angry and disgruntled natives.<br/><br/>The popping up of &quot;employment agencies&quot; bringing large numbers of certain ethnic groups for work in factories and agriculture - bypassing the local unemployed youth and creating employment solely for migrants rather than locals is another aspect of this  migration process which has alienated local communities and created huge amounts of resentment - especially as house prices have spiralled out of control and local people feel powerless to do anything about the situation.<br/><br/>The EU and the politicians have singularly failed to deal with the migration issue; the damage it has done to long standing cohesive communities; the impact outside urban areas and the realisation (very late in the day) that the majority of people (as per Brexit) are not willing to continue to tolerate massive influxes of foreign cheap labour at the expensive them losing their country; their culture and way of life.<br/><br/>The lack of consent in the implementation of these policies has been lamentable.  It is not possible in any change project - particularly one as ambitious as the EU wanted it to be to undertake such a massive change without any consultation with the people who would be directly affected by it.<br/><br/>Had immigrants been largely benign and willing to assimilate that would be one thing which may have helped, but certainly in the case of large scale Muslim immgrants from war torn areas of the middle east, we have a huge assimilation problem, combined with toxic tribal; inter ethnic fighting and merging already troubled communities into modern first world States in Europe where the  &quot;mindset&quot; and cultural values are so distant to eachother no one should be a bit surprised that these communities cannot understand  let alone assimilate into a world that bears no relationship to the one they have just come from.<br/><br/>No is the time to review and re-evaluate the whole EU project.  To put a huge break on immigration and to develop policies to either assimilate or remove communities who are unable to integrate within the European family.  I believe  schemes to return and equip (particularly) Muslim families back to the Middle East to rebuild their countries is a far better approach than trying to force these communities into cultures where they do not belong and will never assimilate into,  That is not to say all MUslims are resistant to assimilation, but clearly there are sects within Islam which are a real and present danger to a western neoliberal way of life and if these people are so unable to accept this way of life then it is in everyone&#39;s best interests they be returned to a society they can better identify with.<br/><br/>Sadly out of both kindness and pragmatism Mrs. Merkel flung open the doors of Germany to those in want, but now she can see that the warnings given by the UK and the decision that made many vote Brexit was actually a huge error.  Now the EU has to deal with this problem or spread the danger to every country in the Shengen agreement an undermine the EU completely.<br/><br/>The UK fired the gun that has made the EU look up - we hope that the EU will rethink itself; deal with the migration issue to the satisfaction of everyone and re-cast itself more as an EEA accepting that &quot;one size fits all&quot; is simply never going to work. <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                In the Netherlands we recieved 2 millions immigrants over the past 40 years. That cost us 200 billion Euro&#39;s. One third of our GDP. It has been studied by scientists. The conclusion is that it  was beneficial for the immigrants and for business, but other than that it had mainly disadvantages. The immigrants placed a heavy burden on social sevices. Also immigrants had higher than average crimerates.  Immigration is only good for society if an immigrant can be placed in a scarce job. Also given the population explosion in the Middle East and in Africa their can be no other feasable policy for Europe than a full stop on immigration. <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                &quot;Only bigots could not see that immigration benefits both hosts and migrants&quot;; So a majority of the British population who voted in the recent referendum are bigots, I disagree. I did not vote to leave as I am a politics graduate, and agreed with the economic experts that leaving the EU would be very damaging. The migrants who are coming are benefiting, the government is also benefiting by reducing the deficit with the taxes earned, however they are not investing in the services that the immigrants and their families are using. Education, housing, health, and the police are all under financed and under strain. The vast majority of refugees are Muslim who are alien to our society who will not mix, employ or marry infidels. IS, ISIS,  ISIL or whatever you wish to call them have told us that they are infiltrating fighters into Europe hence all the attacks in Europe. The 1957 UNHCR and the 1961 protocol was written in the last century and needs to be updated if countries are going to give refuge, refuge should mean refuge, a short stay in safety until it is safe to return and not a life of luxury, often better than the local inhabitants.  <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                Between 1840 and 1914, 55 million people left Europe for the Americas – much larger, relative to population, than migration since WWII. Nearly all the movers were economic migrants,................<br/><br/>Yes, b ut the author forgets one point.  These people were generally homogenous, coming from Europe.  They assimilated and became Americans.<br/><br/>Now the vast majority of immigrants are 3d worlders who bring with them, and keep, their own traditions.  Many have no intention of assimilating.

                You are partly right!  Process of assimilation is often slow depending on cultural, educational ,economic scales.  But believe me it does take place.  It is not always the problem with immigrants.  How many times You have taken the trouble of reading, understanding the history of new comers and inviting them for occasional coffe or dinner?  Well , in this planet , mwhere people of of different colours, food habits and unfamiliar things mixing , mating will take place.  You see neither you or immigrants&#39;s great grand children will take this country  with them. Someday , all will be here six feet below the ground.

But as an example, we don&#39;t require Syria to have the order and authority of, say, Switzerland to resolve the migrant dilemma -- only those levels that were present in Iraq and Afghanistan over the previous ten years, during which time there was no migrant crisis affecting Europe. No doubt Skidelsky considers Iraq and Afghanistan to be disasters in their own right -- but not all disasters are of similar consequence, and the decision to leave Syria to fester is a political choice. <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                Hi Robert,<br/><br/>I will go so far as to say, that if 1% of the world&#39;s population *didn&#39;t* own half of the world&#39;s wealth, there would be plenty left for everyone else. <br/><br/>And that stat is getting *much worse* by the decade, not better.<br/><br/>Due to the &#39;trickle-up&#39; economy, money (wealth) is cascading upwards, threatening all developed nations -- as money velocity M1 and M2 is negatively affected when such large sums are evermore concentrated in the hands of so few.<br/><br/>In any event, with half of the money MIA, it leaves (only) the other half for the rest of us to live on.<br/><br/>Which translates into every small problem, turning into a medium problem (such as refugees and immigration, for one example) and which translates every medium problem into large problems (Brexit, Arab Spring, attempts to recreate the Cold War by some in the West, etc)<br/><br/>The root of all these problems is unrestricted globalization, and an unhelpful factor is the &#39;trickle-up&#39; economy caused by a ridiculously low personal and corporate tax regime for high earners and profiteers.<br/><br/>Solving those two fundamental problems, will virtually solve any follow-on problems -- and shrink problems of any size, relegating them to their proper and historic levels.<br/><br/>The question is; Does our present political leadership have what it takes to solve the problems of our time -- which are orders of magnitude smaller than the problems that were successfully solved by previous generations of leaders, such as WWI, WWII, the beginning of the atomic age, the Cold War and the successful conclusion thereof, segregation in America, large scale famine in Africa, the end of apartheid in South Africa, etc...<br/><br/>Time will tell...<br/><br/>Thank you for posting your excellent essays here at ProSyn.<br/><br/>As always, very best regards, JBS  <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                I have posted this same content on many other articles. (The economists,  pundits and others who author these articles about society, immigration etc are providing so much insight.) The reasons people are coming to the west are well known. The effort by the west to handle the inflow is the obvious problem. The author goes a little too far in mentioning bigotry (unfortunately real bigotry will always be in SOME people&#39;s hearts and minds and cannot be legislated away by gov&#39;t; MOST people adhere to the golden rule IMO in their everyday lives) but rightly mentions leadership. But from which angle? IMO the economies of the west must do a better job setting the conditions for better growth. Of course, THIS is the big dilemma. The political and therefore economic divide within the hosts are large. The left wants higher taxes to support gov&#39;t to redistribute more to the dislocated (and others). But IMO this does not help economic growth.  There was opposition in the past to immigration waves, but b/c economies were growing rapidly, the negativity was largely forgotten as mentioned in article. Yes there are other cultural aspects mentioned in comments and are certainly valid, but until we understand and agree on the conditions that grow the economy the best and implement them, it will be a long slog of, I won&#39;t go as far as to say, tribalism, but the frictions will be amplified. The west can, IMO, handle the influx, but we must have rapid growth to accompany the wave. You may be able to intimate what I think can achieve this outcome, but maybe PS has someone who can write an article instead of a Joe Shmo, like me.    <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                @John<br/><br/>Obviously economic growth eases everything, however significant economic growth is proving elusive. If you look up the current GDP per capita (PPP) for EU members you will see the scale of the problem in reducing the differential which is driving free movemnt within the EU. If you look further afield 50+% of current migration from Africa and the ME is economic migration driven by war, climate change and poverty. The economic growth needed to address this problem in all locations is out of reach so the problem and pressures will continue. I wish it wasnt so but that is where we are<br/><br/>Water or lack of it is the next causation ref page 12 of link<br/><br/>http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231823E.pdf<br/><br/>The following map shows the renewable water issue<br/><br/>http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/maps/MDG_eng.pdf <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                @Jagjeet<br/><br/>I fear we will be looking in the next 30 years at a humanitarian disaster in Northern Africa and eastwards. It was the prospect of  raw hunger that drove Syrians out of refugee camps following food supply failure. The same may occur in Africa. The insistance that Africa industrialises will only exacerbate the drought issues<br/><br/>We will be very lucky if we avoid the fallout<br/><br/>As for the EU and the US. The US has the advantage of remoteness and the EU does not have the resources to deal with this extended regional problem on its doorstep, and very shortly it will not have the public will to deal with it<br/><br/>Domestically - In Paris the reaction was shock and grief. In Nice the reaction was shock, grief.. then booing the French PM saying you have not kept us safe. The next step will be the demand for physical barriers and monitoring in France and heavy control of borders. The various estimates are the French security services will have to do anything up to doubling manpower (another 400,000) and adopting communication pattern recognition. You are looking at the drift of a public to the embracing of a police state. It is a profound step, the loss of liberty to preserve liberty, how is that supposed to work<br/><br/>You can forget Schengen so there will be an economic dampener from that. If there is one thing that has been shown time and time again it is events move faster than policy and the Achilles Heel of the EU is its inability to reform and react due to problems of getting all members to agree. They are still talking as though Schengen was alive<br/><br/>The reality is the EU needs to support externally at least 5 million Syrians or somehow absorb them. Absorbing them looks problematic. Refugees want to go to just a few locations. Thise locations are already saying enough. There is a growing opinion that there will not be any rebuilding of Syria, it is just rubble in many locations. That is before you look anywhere else for problems<br/><br/>On key issues the EU is little more than farcial and Junckers and Shulz are detatched from reality.  <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                @ Steve<br/><br/>Of course, the point you make - is why Free Migration needs to be controlled and channelled, to achieve optimal outcomes.<br/>When Partition happened, millions were displaced - Delhi had a population of 400,000 in 1947, now bursting beyond 25 million.<br/>Migration - albeit forced by the partition - was responsible not only for most of the increase, but also in hindsight, for Economics.<br/>The energies unleashed by migration - created a momentum of economic growth, that made Delhi the Economic Epicentre today.<br/>Not the best template , yet perhaps explains why Migration can create enormous Macroeconomics.<br/><br/>China of course has taken its template from The Anglosphere - instead of cross border migration, they have harnessed Urban Migration.<br/>The original inhabitants of - Hong Kong Shanghai Beijing  - perhaps grateful for their transformation into Megapolises, becoming millionaires.<br/>Just as the original inhabitants of - Delhi Bombay Calcutta - perhaps grateful for their transformation into Megapolises, becoming millionaires.<br/>Big City created SIZE - beneficial both to the original inhabitants as well as the incoming migrants.<br/><br/>Hence there is a template in my mind that explains - the inflow from Europe to London in 20 years perhaps explains the boom in prices.<br/>Nearly 5 million from Europe could easily transform Greater London into the Size of another New York.<br/>The Pearl River Delta around Hongkong has plans that could transform PRD into the World&#39;s Largest MegaCity - nearly 80 million.<br/>Migration has potential that creates massive Macroeconomics - MegaCities means Millionaires.<br/><br/>Assimilation always difficult - but as you say, economic growth eases everything - but One Language perhaps the Ace.<br/>That Europe never blessed with - the Mandarins perhaps comprehending the utility of One Language much better.<br/><br/> <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                I think this migrant rush is a result of stresses many nations are feeling as we lose the wealth creation we had when fossil fuels were cheap. MENA nations are in the vanguard of this because of the added disruption caused by The USA and others destabilisation policies in search for cheap oil and gas. In reality all the exodus to Europe should be diverted to the USA as being the main culprit and the best outcome for them as well.<br/><br/>But resistance will only grow. Neo-liberal destruction of jobs for the locals will only exacerbate stresses with new arrivals also seeking work that will not be there for both sections of the community.

                In the past, the United States absorbed immigrants from other cultures because... after a generation they assimilated! After all, they had no choice, as they lived too far from their native lands to maintain constant contact and return on cheap air flights.  That&#39;s not the case today. We may be fragmenting socially as a result. Although this presently appears to be a problem for the Republican party, It&#39;s also hard to imagine the Democrat party surviving as a congregation of competing interests. White males are not the only group who don&#39;t necessarily get along with people who are different. <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                The migration puzzle is a tough one. Eastern europeans joining with western europeans might have worked, had there not been the simultaneous desire to move economic activity outside of the EU entirely to China, and to absorb immigrants from outside the EU.<br/><br/>Result is a segment of population in western EU who blame the EU for immigrants from eastern europe, people remaining in eastern EU blame the EU for letting migrants from entirely outside the EU cut the line in front of *them*, and also having economic activity eastern europe was supposed to get from western europe to outside of europe entirely. <br/><br/>Seems like the european project bit off far more than it could chew in terms of opening up all kinds of flows at once. And let&#39;s not forget the Euro, which resulted in unjustified continent-wide fall in interest rates, a bubble which then burst with neither the shock-absorber of currency devaluation, nor the shock absorber of government borrowing (Maasticht rules). Ouch. <br/><br/>Yes, far too much at once. There will be some steps backwards, which will solve only slow the rate of worsening, without really solving the problems that have built up. Much credit to the author for realizing that.<br/><br/>Now the final part...  How, oh How, might benevolent policy makers get governments in the middle east from spontaneously falling? Where, oh where, is the explanation for endogenous regime change and destabilization? Hm. <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                Mr. Skidelsky, <br/><br/>some of my ancestors were Huguenots who found refuge in Brandenburg-Prussia. It is important to note that Huguenots were often highly educated and intelligent, so equating them with today&#39;s refugees from the developing world is a bit misleading: <br/>&#39;&#39;The exodus of Huguenots from France created a brain drain, as many Huguenots had occupied important places in society. The kingdom did not fully recover for years.&#39;&#39; - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot#Effects <br/>&#39;&#39;Huguenot refugees in Prussia are thought to have contributed significantly to the development of the textile industry in that country.&#39;&#39; - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot#Prussia <br/><br/>Also the violence in the Islamic world is not merely of a political and religious nature, in my opinion. <br/><br/>I pointed to following study before, which found a high prevalence (15.6%) of the low-activity MAOA-2R allele in a control group taken from the Saudi Arabian population: <br/>El-Tarras et al. &#39;&#39;Association study between the dopamine-related candidate gene polymorphisms and ADHD among Saudi Arabia population via PCR technique&#39;&#39; <br/>See Table 1 (one) on page 3 (three): http://adhdnet.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/El-Tarras-2012-Association-study-betwee.pdf <br/><br/>&#39;&#39;An association between the 2R allele of the VNTR region of the gene and an increase in the likelihood of committing serious crime or violence has been found.[18][19][20]&#39;&#39; - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_A#Antisocial_behavior <br/><br/>Low-activity MAOA-2R is very rare in Caucasians (~0.2%). <br/><br/>I personally suspect, that MAOA-2R is more common in the Islamic/Arab world than in the West due to certain cultural traditions and customs in the Islamic/Arab region: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage#Middle_East_2 <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                History does not repeat exactly the same, but at the time in the US the economic underpinning of the family farm was changing with many moving to newly industrialized factories, Chinese labor was brought to the Pacific Coast for the railroads. Many then migrated to jobs in fisheries and canneries. While they were not that numerous, they were visibly not &quot;White&quot; and not Christian. Those markers made them easy targets for the White European Christian population who chased and burned them out and the US Congress enacted the exclusion acts.  Later the north European Nordic Protestants turned on the South Slav Catholics. Catholicism was labeled a devilish and political religion and Judaic religion was tagged as Asiatic and not compatible with North American advanced civilization.  <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                @Steve<br/><br/>Sorry, but I don&#39;t agree with you. Migrations and Refugees are triggered by the lack of conditions on home countries, not the wealth of the receiving ones. Wealth difference among countries has stayed more or less the same, but migration patterns vary and I believe they are correlated with the deterioration of living conditions on the homes.<br/><br/>We in Portugal are experts in migration; country has been exporting people for centuries and always in moments of crisis. So, IMO, the only option is for the receiving countries to help the home countries in this moments of crisis, but off course the wont because that would mean ignoring low cheap labor, and people willing to do what others don’t want to do.<br/> <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                @Jose<br/><br/>I am not saying that I agree Hungary as a model, just that logic dicates that matters head that way. <br/><br/>The migration pressures will not abate, the flows are high enough and crucially persistent enough that natives will demand restrictions. Building and maintaining physical boundaries is actually quite cheap. If porous boundaries such as Greece cannot be maintained they will move inland, and have already in fact. Changing definitons and resticting benefits even cheaper. In the face of terrorist acts the public will demand more surveilence and intrusion privacy will be lost. <br/><br/>If it is a choice of a an axe in your head or your kid being run over by a truck or a loss of privacy most will opt for the loss.

The inclusion of New EU is bringing New EU mentality solutions and de facto devaluing Old EU aspirations so it is a cultural issue. Events will allow New EU solutions to gain ground forever changing the EU. Old EU will then have a identity crisis and react with isolationism, it is already in process. Schengen has failed, the euro is applying debt stress and economically there are major growth problems. New EU is simply a economic and direct grant transfer from Old EU supposedly paid for by the economic pie growing, which is not happening<br/> <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                @Steve, I beg to disagree, most of us like the countries we live in, we don&#39;t have an incentive to migrate if not to make a living. The solution can&#39;t ever be border controle, because no wall can resist a massive movement of people.<br/><br/>The philosophy can&#39;t be the exploitation of other countries for profit, but actually there must be the involvement of developed countries in the well being of the home countries.<br/><br/>Not what has been done to Portugal, Ireland or Greece by the EU, who actually impoverished and send millions to unemployment, and then they complain they have to many migrants…<br/><br/>By the way Hungary is example of nothing, unless you are talking of the violation of human rights. Hungary under the current regime should never be in the EU, I actually feel ashamed such country is allowed to be a part of the union.<br/> <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                @Jose<br/><br/>As Gerald has pointed out at the start of the comments there is opinion that if you raise the standard of living in the countries outside the EU that the migrants come from then all that will happen is they will have the cash to migrate. If so there is no solution to migration other than border control. The future therefore in all likelihood will be the Hungarian model. As for the number that would like to move to the EU - pick a figure, 5million, 60 million, 250 million, they are all out of the air and all equally valid <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>

                The desire to migrate has only just started. Population explosion and a growing drought belt will motivate many more. There is no border control strategy at present in the EU, Frontex runs a dail-a-ride from international waters and EU border control is subcontracted to a non EU state. It is obvious this cannot continue longterm. I cannot see the EU either being able to influence drought or population growth elsewhere leaving only EU border control, which at present is shambolic. As long as it remains shambolic you can forget Schengen<br/><br/>40% muslim unemployment in Nice is cited as a root social problem. As this level of unemployment is present in other groups in the EU it is time attention was given to unemployment levels.
