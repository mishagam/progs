<DIV class="headline2">TRTL Pillow, <EM>Lobster, Movie Freak</EM></DIV>


<P>Those <STRONG>little airplane pillows have always been worse than useless.</STRONG>  A rectangular pillow does
what, exactly?  If you put it behind your head, it pushes your head forward.  Since the seats
barely recline in economy class, that means that when you try to lie back, the pillow thwarts you.</P>


<P>So if you're by the window, you try to put the pillow between your head and the side of the
airplane.  How long does <EM>that</EM> work?  Not very long before the pillow slides down or back.  Your
lucky if you can catch it against your shoulder to sort of prop it up for maybe a ten-minute
catnap.  Eventually, though, it's going to end up in your lap -- or on the floor behind your seat.</P>


<P>More than two decades ago, I bought my first <STRONG>horseshoe-shaped airplane pillow.</STRONG>  It was
inflatable, so I could pack it in my carry-on, then blow it up and drape it around my neck, across
my shoulders.  It stayed in place.</P>


<P>But since it was rubberized or plastic or some other airtight material, it was neither absorbent nor
cool.  In other words, <STRONG>if I actually fell asleep wearing it, my neck and cheeks dripped with
sweat</STRONG> -- and my shirt collar could have watered a houseplant.</P>


<P>Then I had to open the valve and squeeze out as much air as possible before tucking the pillow
back into my bag.</P>


<P>Was it Brookstone or some other company that first popped up with the soft-fabric, absorbent
padded neck pillow?  I saw it in an airport, bought it, and tried it out on the next leg of my
journey.  Then I threw away my old inflatable pillow.</P>


<P>The problem now was not inflation and deflation.  This pillow stayed the same size.  It came in a
convenient zippered plastic carrying case, which was not at all convenient, and I ended up
carrying the pillow onto planes in a canvas tote bag.</P>


<P>Since I invariably leave on flights with only a couple of hours of sleep the night before, <STRONG>in-flight
sleeping is a necessity, and those horseshoe-shaped padded pillows saved my neck.</STRONG> 
Literally.</P>


<P>But let's face it.  Carrying it as my "personal bag" -- the equivalent of a woman's purse, which
can be brought on the plane along with a laptop bag or other carry-on -- meant that I couldn't
carry anything else.  So I'd jam in a couple of bottles of Hint Water that I bought once I had
passed security, along with a bag of M&amp;Ms or pretzels and maybe a book and ... very soon there
wasn't room for everything I thought I needed.</P>


<P>A couple of weeks ago, I caught an ad on Facebook for a <STRONG>travel pillow that calls itself TRTL.</STRONG> 
When you read it aloud, it's supposed to sound like "turtle."</P>


<P>In use, it looks like a scarf.  But inside that absorbent soft scarf, there's some structure -- a
somewhat flexible but mostly rigid plastic frame.  The frame rests on one of your shoulders, and
when you rock your head slightly to that side, it holds your head up without any effort from you.</P>


<P>That means you can sleep with your head tilted to the side, no matter which seat you're in.  On
that horrible flight from Singapore to Djakarta, where I was almost screaming with sleepiness
and the flight attendant would not let me tilt my seat back even the three centimeters that was all
the movement it could do, because the passenger behind me needed to eat his leisurely banquet,
composed of "food," without my seat back getting in his way, <STRONG>I could have used the TRTL
Travel Pillow because it works even when your seat isn't reclined.</STRONG></P>


<P>In fact it simply works.  You <EM>look</EM> like you're feeling a bit of a chill and you've wrapped a scarf
around your neck.  But it's as if an EMT had wrapped your neck in a plastic brace to keep you
from injuring yourself.  That's how firmly you're supported.  And yet it's comfortable enough
that you can sleep.</P>


<P>No, let me be specific: It's comfortable enough that <EM>I</EM> can sleep.</P>


<P>You can order the TRTL NapScarf Pillow from Brookstone.com, or the Trtl Neck Pillow from
Amazon.com.  Or healthyback.com, or thegrommet.com.  Just google Trtl Neck Pillow and you
can even order it from various outlets in Britain.</P>


<P>It costs $30 from Amazon or Brookstone.  But if you try it, I think you'll find that you won't use
it only on plane trips.  Because if there's any place where <STRONG>sleep is even more difficult than on
an airplane -- and yet more desirable -- it's on a car trip.</STRONG></P>


<P>Hours and hours and hours of sitting.  Yet you have the same pillow problem as on planes --
rectangular pillows don't stay put, and in a car, the back seats probably don't recline.  (Not in the
kind of car <EM>I</EM> can afford, anyway.)</P>


<P>So maybe the next time you plan a family car trip to some place of near-lunar remoteness, like
the west coast or the Outer Banks or, you know, Maine, you might want to consider the price of
enough TRTL neck pillows for all your passengers as one of the expenses of the trip.</P>


<P>Especially you need one for the adult who's going to spell you off when you get tired.  Doesn't
that person need to get as rested as possible, so you can get a nice long nap with <EM>your</EM> TRTL
pillow when it's <EM>your</EM>&nbsp;turn to sleep?</P>


<P>Look, this isn't going to replace your bed pillow, ever.  But <STRONG>when you have to try to sleep
sitting up, I've never found a solution half as good.</STRONG></P>


<P>And while it doesn't fold up as snug as my old inflatable pillow, it takes up way less room than
the U-shaped pillows of the past couple of decades.</P>

<P><CENTER>*</CENTER>
</P>

<P>I believe that on Uncle Orson's Weirdness Meter, <STRONG>the strangest movie ever made may well be
<EM>The Lobster.</EM></STRONG>  Writer/director <STRONG>Yorgos Lanthimos</STRONG> has created a sci-fi social commentary about a
society in which people are required to pair up, and if, after a reasonable amount of time, they
remain alone, they will undergo an operation in which they are permanently converted into an
animal of their choosing.</P>


<P>Most people choose dogs.  There are goats, donkeys, horses, birds.  David (Colin Farrell) has
chosen, if he fails to find a mate to replace his erstwhile wife, to be turned into a lobster.</P>


<P>The reason seems to be that he really is a loner by disposition, and by choosing a lobster, he
expects to be left alone to live a long, contented life Under the Sea.  (Cue music.  No, wait ... this
isn't a Disney musical.)</P>


<P>The movie opens with a grimly determined woman driving out into the countryside, where <STRONG>she
locates a particular donkey and shoots it with a pistol. </STRONG> Apparently, divorce wasn't enough for
her, and she had managed to track down her ex.</P>


<P>David checks into a sort of mate-finding resort, where very strict rules are enforced by the hotel
staff.  They seem to think that the inmates need instruction and encouragement to get their
mating drive on.  If a couple form an attachment, they are immediately set apart from the loners;
to help them develop an even stronger love, they may be supplied with a child.  Their last test or
training ground is a fortnight on a yacht.</P>


<P>Everyone seems to labor under <STRONG>the delusion that attachments can only form between people
who are alike in some significant way.</STRONG>  For instance, there's an attractive young woman who
gets nosebleeds.  The man who fancies her bashes his face into things until his nose bleeds so
that she'll think he has her same nosebleed tendency.  This fakery forms the basis of a bond
between them.</P>


<P>All of these things, weird as they are, seem intended to shine a spotlight on our own society, on
the perpetual drive for everyone to pair up.  In service of this goal, many people do attempt to
deceive each other into thinking that they're they ideal mate for their lover-of-choice.  And those
who fail to pair up -- or simply prefer not to -- are often treated as if they were not worthy of
full personhood.</P>


<P><EM>The Lobster,</EM> for all its programmed oddness, is a love story, though it feels as though the movie
is half over before we even meet David's love interest -- a woman who shares his
nearsightedness (Rachel Weisz).  Meanwhile, they have both become involved with a group of
illegal loners, who refuse to pair up <EM>and</EM> refuse to renounce their personhood.  This group is every
bit as restrictive and perhaps a little more cruel than the hotel staff.</P>


<P>By the end, it's hard to decode just what Yorgos Lanthimos means by all this.  I suspect that,
despite all his intentions to make a satire on our society's mating customs, he fell in love with
David and his nearsighted beloved, so in the end, his story becomes <STRONG>a tale of just how far we'll
go, or won't go, to become or remain worthy of the one we love.</STRONG></P>


<P>I'm with him on that.  I also came to care far more than I expected, and I liked this movie kind of
a lot -- the way I liked Adam Sandler's turn in <EM>Punch Drunk Love.</EM>  I don't expect anybody I
know to like it as much as I do.</P>


<P>In fact, since I saw this with my wife and daughter, I happily report that my daughter was iffy
about the film, but seemed to lean toward liking it.  Whereas my wife hated, hated, hated it.  I
have never seen her <STRONG>emerge from a film we watched all the way through with quite such an
adamant hatred </STRONG>for what she has just seen.</P>


<P>Years ago, when I thought <EM>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</EM> was the best movie of its year, I
warned the readers of this column that this was going to be a minority taste, that many of the
events would be inexplicable and that most people would probably hate the movie or at least by
confused by it.</P>


<P>Even with that warning, when my wife and I went back to see it again (this one my wife liked as
much as I did), a fellow audience member, apparently a reader of this column, made it a point to
say, quite loudly, as she passed me: "This is the worst movie I've ever seen."</P>


<P>I assumed she was annoyed with me for raving about the movie.  <EM>But I warned her.</EM>  It's not my
fault if she didn't heed my warning.</P>


<P>So I'm warning you now, and please pay attention: <STRONG>Most people will hate this movie.</STRONG></P>


<P>But if you think satirical views of our society are interesting, even when they're extravagantly
odd, then you'll be rewarded with some marvelous performances by many actors, especially
Colin Farrell, who gained a lot of weight to play this schlub of a character.  (I must confess right
now that I would have to lose about eighty pounds to be as out-of-shape as Colin Farrell is in this
role; his schlub body is the one I aspire to achieve.)</P>


<P>The filming is beautifully matter-of-fact, and there's <STRONG>a lot of pleasure in spotting various
animals scattered throughout the scenery,</STRONG> every one of them, presumably, a person who failed
to come to an arrangement with a love interest before the deadline.</P>


<P>The movie has its rewards.  It does make you think about how it is we go about forming
attachments.  All the awkward social rituals, like dances and other activities, are so hopelessly
inadequate to meet someone you might actually like that you begin to wonder how anybody ever
falls in love at all.</P>


<P>It makes you think.  And in my case, it also made me feel.</P>


<P>So <STRONG>for people with my level of tolerance for significant weirdness and intellectual
pretentiousness</STRONG> in film, <EM>The Lobster</EM> is spot on.</P>


<P>But if the <EM>Fast &amp; Furious</EM> or <EM>X-Men</EM> franchises have the kinds of human relationships you're
more interested in, this movie is going to have you wishing for death if you can't get out of the
theater <EM>right now.</EM></P>


<P>And I'm not disrespecting <EM>Fast &amp; Furious.</EM>  I've never seen any of that franchise in a theater, but
I've watched a couple of them now (most recently #6, the one with the huge airplane that luckily
finds a twenty-mile-long runway so there's room to do all their stunts as the plane manages a
fifteen-minute touch-and-go passenger pickup) and I really liked them.  So it's not that I have
some kind of rarefied taste in films.  I like regular movies as well as weird ones.</P>


<P><EM>The Lobster</EM> is weird.  I warned you.</P>


<P>It's playing at the Red Cinemas.  Make sure to catch it soon, because I doubt it will be in the
theater for long.</P>


<P>And when it makes it onto cable TV, I don't expect it to go into heavy rotation there, either. 
Wherever it goes, it's going to be a minority taste.</P>

<P><CENTER>*</CENTER>
</P>

<P><STRONG>Owen Gleiberman, for many years the lead film critic for <EM>Entertainment Weekly,</EM></STRONG><EM></EM> has written
a memoir of how movie-watching has formed one of the main threads of his life.</P>


<P>I found his book, <STRONG><EM>Movie Freak: My Life Watching Movies,</EM> to be compulsively readable.</STRONG> 
Gleiberman is astonishingly candid, and seems not to have pulled any punches in his writing
about his friends, rivals, bosses, co-workers, and foes in the world of film criticism.</P>


<P>Now, I'm a reviewer, but unlike Gleiberman, my income does not depend on whether an editor
likes my reviews.  I'm not paid for writing for the <EM>Rhino,</EM> and while our fearless editors do not
simply print whatever I turn in, if they fired me I wouldn't have either a financial or an identity
crisis.</P>


<P>In fact, by Gleiberman's standards, I'm a mere dilettante at best, not even up to the level of a
Yelp reviewer, because they have to be concise and I do not.</P>


<P>Of course, by the end of his memoir, as <EM>Entertainment Weekly</EM> parts company with Gleiberman,
he reports the pleasure he gets from <STRONG>the freeform extravagance that's possible when
discussing films on the web.</STRONG>  So ... maybe he wouldn't despise the kind of thing I do.</P>


<P>Yeah, he would.  Because, even though I've paid close attention to movies since I was little, I
had almost an opposite take on everything.</P>


<P>Gleiberman first fell in love with crappy horror movies on late-night television, back in the pre-streaming, pre-cable, pre-DVD, pre-VCR days when you watched what was on and that was that. 
A lot of his youth and college life was spent poring over the scheduled showings at campus and
art-house cinemas.  You could yearn to see a particular film by a particular director, yet have to
wait years before it happened to play somewhere.</P>


<P>I, too, saw movies that same way -- but my list of movies does not overlap with his youthful list
at any point.</P>


<P>That's because I've always hated horror movies.  I hate bad horror movies because they're bad,
and because they're horror movies.  I hate good horror movies because I hate to be frightened by
made-up stories and <STRONG>the better the horror movie, the more it scares me.</STRONG></P>


<P>I have loved only two horror movies -- three if you count Brian de Palma's <EM>Phantom of the
Paradise,</EM> which I see as a musical comedy.  The two are <STRONG><EM>Poltergeist</EM> and <EM>Let's Scare Jessica to
Death,</EM></STRONG> but in the years since <EM>Poltergeist</EM> I have managed to avoid almost all horror movies and
the more I hear about the "great" ones, the less inclined I am to ever, ever see them.</P>


<P>Meanwhile, where <EM>his</EM>&nbsp;parents gave him carte blanche and even took him to movies that my
parents would never have considered letting me see, my movie-going was mostly guided by my
mom's love for Jeannette McDonald and Nelson Eddy operettas.  I can sing every song in
<EM>Naughty Marietta,</EM> my mother's favorite, right along with the actors.  And since <STRONG>I can act better
than Nelson Eddy even with my mouth numb from a root canal</STRONG> (so can you; so can
everybody), these movies made me feel as if movie acting might be within my reach.</P>


<P>It is not.  It never was.  I'm glad I didn't break my heart trying.</P>


<P>But when your experience of movies growing up almost always involves either singing or a lot of
period costumes, <STRONG>you're not going to grow up with a taste for the "cool" and "innovative" in
film.</STRONG></P>


<P>By the time I started reviewing movies regularly, I already had a rule: If I wouldn't go see a
particular movie if I <EM>weren't</EM> a reviewer, I'm not going to go see it just so I can review it.</P>


<P>Gleiberman, on the other hand, was insatiable.  Even if he thought he was going to <EM>hate</EM> a movie,
he had to go see it, not because he was going to be paid for writing about it, but because he
couldn't bear not to know about every possible kind of movie.</P>


<P>The result is that <EM>Movie Freak</EM> is full of short commentaries on a <EM>lot</EM>&nbsp;of movies, and I can
honestly tell you that <EM>every</EM>&nbsp;movie that Gleiberman hates, I can see his point of view.  I like some
of them anyway, but <STRONG>everything he says against them is true.  I just don't care.</STRONG></P>


<P>However, when it comes to the movies Gleiberman is really enthusiastic about, I can happily tell
you that there is <EM>not one</EM> that I would be willing to go to, because life is short and I don't need
that nonsense in my memory.</P>


<P><EM>Movie Freak</EM> is not <EM>just</EM> about movies.  It's also a memoir of Gleiberman's life -- his strange
relationship with his parents, his friends or lack of friends at different stages of his life, <STRONG>his long
and strange relationship with noted reviewer Pauline Kael.</STRONG></P>


<P>Here are three quotes from Kael that give you an idea of things Gleiberman may have learned
from her.  First, a quote he repeats a couple of times: "In the arts, <STRONG>the critic is the only
independent source of information.  The rest is advertising."</STRONG></P>


<P>Then, a quote that Gleiberman clearly lived by, and I do not: "Movies are so rarely great art that
if we cannot appreciate great trash we have very little reason to be interested in them."</P>


<P>And finally, a quote from Kael about the art and practice of film criticism: <STRONG>"A mistake in
judgment isn't fatal, but too much anxiety about judgment is."</STRONG></P>


<P>In other words, if you're afraid of making a mistake, you'll never write good criticism; and if you
write good criticism, getting it wrong now and then doesn't make you a failure as a critic.</P>


<P>Gleiberman's candor about his own personal habits is, um, kind of extreme.  I didn't want to
know quite that much about many of his personal decisions and habits.  Yet he writes well, and
his very candor about distasteful things makes me trust him a bit more about the things he's
proud of.</P>


<P>If you care about the quality of films, as I do, then I think <STRONG>you'll probably enjoy Gleiberman's
memoir whether you agree with his judgments or not.</STRONG>  I often don't, yet I found his reasons
for liking films I hate (and vice-versa) were very illuminating, and invited me to examine my
own standards of judging, not just film, but everything.</P>


<P>Here's where I think the biggest philosophical difference between Gleiberman and me comes
out: Gleiberman loves <EM>film.</EM>  He loves the whole experience of it, the good and the bad.  He
repeatedly says that he went into the theater hoping for transformation every time.  He was
searching for meaning in life, all the more because his parents provided very little guidance in
that department.</P>


<P>It is very telling, however, that near the end of the book, when he finally falls in love and ceases
his four-month-per-love serial monogamy, when he and his wife have a couple of daughters, <STRONG>he
no longer feels quite the same hope and hunger when he goes to the movies.</STRONG></P>


<P>And that's because he actually <EM>has</EM> meaning in his life that no movie is likely to compare to.  He
has found love and purpose in his family.  (And thus we will not hear of Gleiberman turning into
a lobster or a donkey anytime soon, <EM>pace</EM> <EM>The Lobster.)</EM></P>


<P>I have never gone into the movies expecting them to provide me with meaning and purpose,
because I've never lacked for either in my life and never, never imagined that anyone in
Hollywood knew anything that I didn't already know much better than.</P>


<P><STRONG>Gleiberman goes to movies for the <EM>movieness</EM> of them.</STRONG></P>


<P>I go to movies for the <EM>stories.</EM>  If the story is empty or foolish or stupid or malicious, then I don't
really care how "well" it's made.</P>


<P>It's not that Gleiberman doesn't care about the content of movies.  It's that his judgment depends
more on the <EM>artistry</EM> of the films than on the stories they tell.</P>


<P><STRONG></STRONG>So he gives his perfunctory recognition that <EM>Citizen Kane</EM> is the greatest movie, ya-da ya-da.  But
I don't.  Because all I see in <EM>Citizen Kane</EM> is the relentless vanity of an empty blowhard -- not
Kane, but Orson Welles -- whose "artistry" is so heavy-handed I'm not sure but what he thought
of moviemaking as blacksmithery, with his message the hammer and his anvil the audience.</P>


<P>I will forgive some ineptness in the art of filmmaking for a story that I care about and believe in. 
But if I hate every character and every word they say, I walk out and never look back.  I neither
know nor care how <EM>Pulp Fiction</EM> ended, because the only happy ending for that movie, after the
thirty minutes I saw, would be for <STRONG>every character in it to be smashed and instantly killed by
the tank that crunched its way up the freeway in <EM>Fast &amp; Furious 6.</EM></STRONG><EM></EM></P>


<P>I have despised the promos for every Quentin Tarantino film because they <EM>all</EM> seem to be
intellectually pretentious and violently childish.  I've given Scorsese a few more chances because
of <EM>Taxi Driver</EM> and because in his rare interviews he's not such a vain and empty-headed donkey
as Tarantino.</P>


<P>Gleiberman admires both directors for their artistry -- and boasts a little about being real-life
friends with Tarantino.  All I can see is that Tarantino and Scorsese make appalling, obvious,
ineffective artistic choices.</P>


<P>But let's give Gleiberman his due: He is willing to admit that in Marisa Tomei's Broadway
revival of <EM>Wait Until Dark,</EM> Tarantino's acting as Harry Roat, Jr., sucked with great suction (my
choice of words, not his).</P>


<P>And <STRONG>when Gleiberman became good friends with Ben Affleck,</STRONG> he admits that this may have
led to his shaving perhaps ten percent off of his criticisms of Affleck's performances in some
roles.  Because, you know, good friends are hard to find and no matter what people might claim,
<EM>everybody</EM> suffers from harsh criticism, especially when it comes from a friend.</P>


<P>It's barely worth mentioning Gleiberman's fawning relationship with the worst living film
director, Oliver Stone.  Gleiberman admires him for his artistry, so he doesn't need to fudge on
reviews of his friend.  <STRONG>I loathe Oliver Stone because every time he deals with facts, he lies,
lies, lies </STRONG>to promote his point of view.  In other words, Gleiberman loves the filmitude, and I
loathe the storiness of Oliver Stone's movies.</P>


<P>One of the things I found most endearing about <EM>Movie Freak</EM> was that Gleiberman read it for the
audiobook himself.  He's a very good reader, but what I found most charming was how many
words he mispronounced, thereby revealing that even though they were part of his writing
vocabulary, he learned these words by reading them.</P>


<P>Most amusingly, he used the word "comely" in reference to an attractive woman at least three
separate times.  And each time, <STRONG>he pronounced it to rhyme with homely, as if the word were
"comb-ly."</STRONG></P>


<P>In America, "homely" and "comely" are opposites (in Britain, "homely" has warm, friendly, and
attractive connotations), and I think it's charming that Gleiberman made them rhyme in his head. 
But they do not rhyme.</P>


<P>If Gleiberman's book had shown him to be a vain, pretentious git, then such revelations of
ignorance would have come as delightful pinpricks in his vanity.  Instead, because his book is the
<EM>opposite</EM> of pretentious, and he reveals himself to be made of too, too solid flesh, his
mispronunciations are endearing.</P>


<P>Thus I forgive him for being completely clueless about <EM>Lord of the Rings</EM>, the book.  His
criticisms of <EM>Lord of the Rings</EM>, the movies, are spot on.</P>


<P>Look, not everybody wants to read the memoirs of a film critic.  I can assure you that if <EM>I</EM>&nbsp;ever
wrote a book about My Life Watching Movies, you'd have to be desperate for reading material to
waste even a moment reading it.  But Gleiberman's life is interesting, as are his views of film. 
His book helped me understand why, though I so often disagree with him, I have still found all
his reviews worth reading.</P>


<P>And a would-be film critic -- or, for that matter, a would-be screenwriter -- <STRONG>would be hard-pressed to find a better school than Gleiberman's</STRONG> observations about film as art and movies as
a business.</P>
