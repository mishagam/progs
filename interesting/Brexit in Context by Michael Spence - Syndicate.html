                <p data-line-id="4e7810f231bc43e48d8c38f31663392d">MILAN – I do not believe that foreigners contribute usefully by issuing strong opinions about how a country’s citizens, or those of a larger unit like the European Union, should decide when faced with an important political choice. Our insights, based on international experience, may sometimes be helpful; but there should never be any confusion about the asymmetry of roles.
</p>
<p data-line-id="32f9e80155604acda372364abf904883">This is particularly true of the British referendum on whether to remain in the EU. Just days before the vote, the outcome is too close to call, and there appear to be enough undecided voters to tip it either way. But, with political and social fragmentation extending well beyond Europe, outsiders may be able to add some perspective on what is really at issue.

<p data-line-id="3678f5dd99e8457eba3f28c49aa61b8e">First, it will come as no surprise that, in terms of the distribution of income, wealth, and the costs and benefits of forced structural change, growth patterns in most of the developed world have been problematic for the past 20 years. We know that globalization and some aspects of digital technology (particularly those related to automation and disintermediation) have contributed to job and income polarization, placing sustained pressure on the middle class in every country.
</p>
<p data-line-id="5cdc3745b0954ae88595e1b2e46069ea">Second, Europe’s ongoing crisis (more like a chronic condition) has kept growth far too low and unemployment – especially youth unemployment – unacceptably high. And Europe is not alone. In the United States, while the formal unemployment rate has fallen, large-scale failures in terms of inclusiveness have fueled disenchantment – on both the left and the right – at growth patterns and policies that seem to benefit those at the top disproportionately.
</p>
<p data-line-id="14120bbb0603484c9c6c229ffd384cf8">Given the magnitude of recent economic shocks, developed countries’ citizens might be less unhappy were there evidence of a concerted effort – based on genuine burden sharing – to address these issues. In the context of Europe, that would mean a multinational effort.
</p>
<p data-line-id="f950c00c582844bc94d5046e65facf61">But, for the most part – and again throughout the developed world – effective responses have been missing. Central banks have been left largely alone with objectives that exceed the capacity of their tools and instruments, while elements of the elite wait for a chance to blame monetary policymakers for weak economic performance.
</p>
<p data-line-id="fee20208d33243299dfe64409d14ff7e">In the face of non-monetary policy responses that are somewhere between deficient and non-existent relative to the magnitude of the challenges we face, the natural response in a democracy is to replace the decision-makers and try something different. After all, democracy is a system for experimentation, as well for the expression of citizens’ will. Of course, the “new” may not be better and could be worse – perhaps significantly worse.
</p>
<p data-line-id="de60792dfc2b498f9f7a2bd9732a4f57">Third, the EU is confronting, in more severe form, a problem facing much of the developed world: powerful forces operating beyond the control of elected officials are shaping citizens’ lives, leaving them feeling powerless. But while all countries must deal with the challenges of globalization and technological change, important elements of governance in the EU are beyond the reach of democratic institutions, at least those that people understand and relate to.
</p>
<p data-line-id="7f9af7d4393c410882829c4b7d247112">This is not to say that local governance is problem-free. It isn’t. Corruption, special interests, and sheer incompetence are common problems. But democratic governance is in principle fixable, and institutional defenses and countermeasures do exist.
</p>
<p data-line-id="8095c50332244a5ca31ea61c451f9aea">The situation in the eurozone is particularly unstable, owing to citizens’ growing alienation from a distant, technocratic elite; the absence of conventional economic adjustment mechanisms (exchange rates, inflation, public investment, and so on); and tight limits on fiscal transfers, which send powerful signals about the real boundaries of cohesion.
</p>
<p data-line-id="6ccf77854fd24cd091e9ec0d071d8680">Brexit is a part of this larger drama. It is primarily about governance, not economics. From a strictly economic point of view, the risks for both the United Kingdom and the rest of the EU are almost entirely on the downside. But if that was all there was to the issue, the outcome would be a foregone conclusion in favor of staying.
</p>
<p data-line-id="515ab1654b2f4e48afa15842d53eaf17">The real issue – effective and inclusive self-governance – is not an easy one to tackle anywhere, because forces such as technological disruption do not respect national boundaries. In part, Britons are voting on whether their capacity to navigate in these turbulent waters is enhanced or diminished by continued EU membership. But a more fundamental question of political identity is also at stake – just as it was in Scotland’s independence referendum in 2014.
</p>
<p data-line-id="6de69cfd762646019d550086b1410934">Some Britons (perhaps even a majority), and many other EU citizens, still want future generations to think of themselves as Europeans (albeit with a proud British, German, or Spanish origin), and are prepared to take another shot at reforming Europe’s governance structures. And they are right to think that the world would be a far better place with a united, democratic Europe as a major force for both stability and change.

<p data-line-id="0ca9c5289cf04afa8ca68ca49bfe7b8e">That is my hope, though it may border on wishful thinking. Regardless of the outcome of the Brexit referendum (like many outsiders, I hope Britain votes to stay and <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/uk-future-in-leading-europe-by-gordon-brown-2016-06">advocates for reform</a> from within), the British vote, along with similar strong centrifugal political trends elsewhere, should bring about a major rethink of European governance structures and institutional arrangements. The goal should be to restore a sense of control and responsibility to the electorates.
</p>
<p data-line-id="6248eb466db842399ecaa7d6276cdc2d">That would be a good outcome in the long run. It would require inspired leadership from all corners of Europe – including government, business, organized labor, and civil society as well as a renewed commitment to integrity, inclusiveness, responsibility, and generosity. That is a tall order; but it is not an impossible one to fill.

The notion of &quot;Europe&quot; exceeds by far the institutional framework of the European Union and the two cannot be confused. European community of nations inherits Greek and Roman Traditions, Christianity and the concept of separating between the throne and the altar (it is Christian even if many have forgotten) and the Enlightment (which is, to some extent, anti-Christian). It is about ethics, material culture and political culture. It is about republicanism understood as the responsibility of each citizen for the community and country he lives in, regardless whether it is constitutional monarchy or a republic (e.g. Polish kingdom since XVI century was called &quot;Res Publica&quot;). The institutions of the European Union as they are now are just institutional framework, and the most influential executive part of it (esp. the Commission and surrounding agencies, as e.g. ESMA) have no democratic  mandate at all. No surprise that Europeans, or at least those of them who remember their republican roots, are unhappy with the EU and want to demonstarte their disappointment. In some ways it is the revolutionary situation as Lenin described it before the Russian revolution: the rulers are unable to cope with the challenges  of the time and the people is not willing to help the rulers to find a soulution. It seems like the only way out the EU rulers can imagine now is to push forward even more, which must end, probably quite soon, in an even stronger crash.  <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>            </p>                    </div>            </article></li><li class="user">    <article data-line-id="global" data-comment-id="5769fe3f2bd5d206f8049c7b" data-comment-reply="false" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Comment">        <div>                        <ul class="comment-interaction">                                <li><a href="#" class="reply">Reply</a></li>                                            </ul>                        <h2><span class="commented">Comment</span>                <a href="#" class="commented inlinecomment">Commented</a>                <a href="/profile/d2d7010246f86fd027f92d73" itemprop="author">John Brian Shannon</a>                <time  itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2016-06-22T02:55Z">JUN 22, 2016</time>            </h2>            <p itemprop="text">                Hi Michael,<br/><br/>Opinion<br/><br/>Many non-British commentators have &#39;strongly suggested&#39; to British voters that they should vote to remain (&#39;Bremain&#39;) in the EU, in the June 23 referendum.<br/><br/>Yet, some of those same non-British commentators have told other non-British citizens with opposing views on the issue (&#39;Brexit&#39;) that they should refrain from expressing their strong suggestions.<br/><br/>Which I find odd, and troubling at some level.<br/><br/>I&#39;m glad they&#39;re worried about British voters being unduly influenced by the opinions of others in faraway lands.<br/><br/>But I&#39;m not worried at all<br/><br/>I think British voters are educated enough to be able to discern between the opinions of foreigners, and the opinions of present-day British citizens who are eligible to vote in the referendum.<br/><br/>By and large, Britons are a pretty educated lot and there are many nuances to British society that demonstrate they have plenty of 21st century sophistication.<br/><br/>British voters aren&#39;t likely to get the proverbial wool pulled over their eyes by commentators from around the world. <br/><br/>If they&#39;re susceptible to that, they&#39;ve got bigger problems than staying in, or leaving the EU.<br/><br/>Democracy<br/><br/>I do agree that people shouldn&#39;t be stirring up trouble. After all, it is illegal to run into a crowded theatre and yell, &quot;Fire!&quot; in a convincing way. And for good reason.<br/><br/>But a person can contribute their thoughts about a democratic vote in another country in a way that is designed to not inflame people to untoward behavior.<br/><br/>In fact, freedom of speech goes directly to the heart of the Western democracies.<br/><br/>And whether we&#39;re commenting about the goings-on in our own country or in our fellow Commonwealth nations, fair comment ought to be encouraged -- as long as the commentator refrains from unduly inciting the voters of that nation.<br/><br/>Economics<br/><br/>Some commentators have made the case for, or against, the economic angle. It&#39;s true that UK GDP has risen since it joined the EU.<br/><br/>Even euro-skeptics admit that United Kingdom GDP has risen -- as compared to not joining the European Union.<br/><br/>How could it not? The EU is the largest single economic unit on the planet, slightly larger in total economic output than the United States and larger than other great economic powers such as the rising tiger in China.<br/><br/>Not that the bottom two economic quintiles in the UK have seen it!<br/><br/>The economic question, then, becomes; <br/><br/>Will voting to &#39;Stay&#39; or &#39;Leave&#39; the EU result in higher income for the bottom two quintiles?<br/><br/>They&#39;re certainly not seeing it now while still part of the EU! Therefore, what would make their cohort expect to see higher incomes by staying in the European Union?<br/><br/>In fact, people in the UK&#39;s bottom two quintiles say that recent and high immigration levels have &#39;stolen&#39; many low-paying jobs from them and UK unemployment statistics seem to bear that out.<br/><br/>One can therefore empathize with very large numbers of people who&#39;ve at the end of the day &#39;lost&#39; more than they&#39;ve gained via EU membership.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to see how many vote in the referendum and to look at their voting patterns, post-referendum.<br/><br/>Governance<br/><br/>Henry Ford used to say; &quot;Don&#39;t tell me what you can do. Show me what you&#39;ve done.&quot;<br/><br/>Many Bremainers are quick to point out that governance in the UK could be improved by staying within the European Union. And it goes without saying that the UK would be a force for good within the European Union as it relates to EU reform.<br/><br/>No doubt there has already been some of that. For one example, some labour standards have improved in the United Kingdom as a direct result of EU labour directives.<br/><br/>It&#39;s too bad that recent (and high) immigration levels took huge numbers of low-paying jobs away from British-born workers, otherwise Britons would be able to witness those labour law improvements instead of reading about it in the broadsheets -- while (not) enjoying life on unemployment insurance.<br/><br/>EU &#39;Mission Creep&#39;<br/><br/>Separate from labour law improvements and lower employment levels for British-born workers, is what could be termed the &#39;bureaucratic mission-creep&#39; of the EU governance structure.<br/><br/>We all know what mission creep means in the military sense, it typically happens during long military campaigns where the fight has been long and hard, and the progress uneven.<br/><br/>Military commanders begin expanding the definitions of engagement and troop commitment on their own volition in order to more quickly or more fully attain their standing orders.<br/><br/>With the exceptionally clear lines of command found in military units, such liberties taken by commanders are almost always caught and rectified.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t know that is always the case with regards to faceless, nameless bureaucrats who are in the business of running the EU&#39;s governmental architecture. Many of whom may not be under the direct authority of duly-elected politicians it must be said.<br/><br/>Instead of following the instructions of their elected leaders, such bureaucrats could easily engage in their own &#39;mission creep&#39; and elected EU politicians wouldn&#39;t know about it unless a whistleblower made it public.<br/><br/>For ambitious (unelected) EU bureaucrats with few checks and balances to worry about: Why bother to go through all the trouble of staging a coup (in a single EU country) in order to get the life they want, when by playing it coy and telling the politicians exactly what they want to hear over a period of years, the bureaucrats could eventually do whatever they want throughout the entire European Union using the levers of power available to them in the existing governance architecture? Maybe with some help from other ambitious (unelected) EU bureaucrats?<br/><br/>Q: What are the chances of that, exactly?<br/>A: About 100% -- given time.<br/><br/>Who would know until it was already too late? How can you see hidden crime? How to stop them?<br/><br/>Given enough time, the unelected functionaries in Brussels will be telling the elected politicians what to do, where to go, and at what time to do it. Some suspect they already are...<br/><br/>It&#39;s bad enough that there are entire portions of the EU governance architecture maintained by powerful unelected individuals. When you factor-in bureaucratic mission creep it quickly scales-up to terrifying dimensions.<br/><br/>Some highly educated and respected commentators have spoken to the lack of democratic legitimacy for EU apparatchiks, and their masters the EU Nomenklatura -- even at this early stage. I guarantee they&#39;re not taking into account the bureaucratic &#39;mission creep&#39; that is guaranteed to occur within the EU governance architecture over time.<br/><br/>It is likely to be cumulative and significant.<br/><br/>Windows of Opportunity<br/><br/>Quite separate from &#39;Stay&#39; or &#39;Leave&#39; debate is the future the British people could attain outside of the European Union political structure.<br/><br/>Some of us think that opportunities as big as the sky would be missed by the United Kingdom permanently joined to the EU.<br/><br/>While some ideas seem fanciful until someone crunches the numbers, a different plan could allow the United Kingdom to excel as never-before.<br/><br/>As there’s no precedent for the Brexit situation it could now become anything the UK government wants it to become.<br/><br/>Teaching Others<br/><br/>Every day, we teach others how to treat us. At a personal level, how we interact with others shows them how to treat us.<br/><br/>Even the political relationship between nation-states are directed by human beings (not artificial intelligence bots) therefore:<br/><br/>As human nature is the foundation of all human relationships;<br/><br/>If we make people feel afraid, they will act defensively toward us.<br/>If we solve their problems, we&#39;re teaching them to become dependent on us.<br/>If we act as their genuine partner, we are teaching them to trust us.<br/>If we act as a team-player, they will either become part of our team or we will become part of theirs -- either way, it works.<br/><br/>If we teach half of the UK population that their concerns aren&#39;t a priority for us right now, we&#39;re teaching them to withdraw from us.<br/><br/>In the end, we reap what we sow.<br/><br/>Summary?<br/><br/>EU membership isn&#39;t working for Britain&#39;s bottom two quintiles and bureaucratic &#39;mission creep&#39; will eventually bring a complete end to democracy within the EU, and Britain might be missing windows of opportunity bigger than the sky for as long as it stays within the EU.<br/><br/>If those reasons (and more that I haven&#39;t touched on) aren&#39;t enough for British voters to exercise their vote carefully, I don&#39;t know what might qualify.<br/><br/>Whatever the results on June 23rd, I support the right of Britons to choose their future. It&#39;s my goal however, to do my part to ensure that they go into the future (whichever way the vote goes) with &#39;eyes wide open&#39; as opposed to &#39;ears stopped shut&#39;.<br/><br/>No matter the outcome of the referendum, the people of Europe have created an astonishing success story out of the rubble of World War II, and I salute their sacrifice, their dedication, and their ingenuity, and I very sincerely wish every one of them eternal peace, prosperity, and good governance.<br/><br/>Present Brexit/Bremain discussions aside, Europe is one of the brightest lights of our civilization. But we must always remember: &quot;To whom much is given, much is expected.&quot;<br/><br/>And some in the UK expected better.<br/><br/>Isn&#39;t that everything?<br/><br/>As always very best regards, JBS <br/><br/>https://johnbrianshannon.com/2016/06/21/bremain-better-opportunity-britons/<br/> <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>            </p>                    </div>                <ol>            <li class="user">    <article data-line-id="global" data-comment-id="576d1a422bd5d206f8adbd0f" data-comment-reply="true" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Comment">        <div>                        <ul class="comment-interaction">                                            </ul>                        <h2><span class="commented">Comment</span>                <a href="#" class="commented inlinecomment">Commented</a>                <a href="/profile/564c3d31bc1f571dc0a8b363" itemprop="author">Steve Hurst</a>                <time  itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2016-06-24T11:32Z">JUN 24, 2016</time>            </h2>            <p itemprop="text">                @John<br/><br/>LOL<br/><br/>Yes the people have spoken, though what they have gotten is another matter, as they have gotten it blind and blind dates dont always work out.

Not one act of violence or intimidation has been reported, and there was no need to station tanks and machine guns outside polling stations in order to guarantee the safety of voters — as is (very unfortunately) required in some nations.<br/><br/>Although some may be disappointed with the result, life will go on, and the people of the United Kingdom will continue to set a wonderful democratic example for the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Each successful democratic poll in the Western democracies, such as yesterday’s referendum, strengthens democracy not only in the UK, but around the world.<br/><br/>I very sincerely thank the citizens of the United Kingdom and their politicians, and the citizens and government of the European Union for their enduring commitment to our shared democratic ideals.<br/><br/>Yesterday’s historic vote sets another great example for our civilization.<br/><br/>As always, very best regards to you.<br/><br/>Cheers, JBS <br/><br/>https://johnbrianshannon.com/2016/06/24/uk-votes-leave-eu-cameron-resigns/ <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>            </p>                    </div>            </article></li><li class="user">    <article data-line-id="global" data-comment-id="576ceeb12bd5d206f8c37362" data-comment-reply="true" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Comment">        <div>                        <ul class="comment-interaction">                                            </ul>                        <h2><span class="commented">Comment</span>                <a href="#" class="commented inlinecomment">Commented</a>                <a href="/profile/541e78cd4a42310ae8c112ce" itemprop="author">jagjeet sinha</a>                <time  itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2016-06-24T08:26Z">JUN 24, 2016</time>            </h2>            <p itemprop="text">                The Truth is OUT.<br/>Migration is a cardinal principle of the EU - and was the overriding issue.<br/>Between Farage and Boris, they were the Two who understood sentiment better than Cameron n Osborne.<br/>Now, they must lead the ship, and provide the departure with the hope that guided them.<br/>As for Migration from the EU - it is up to Germany and France to shoulder the heavy lifting.<br/>The will of the people in a democracy is paramount.<br/>David paid for democracy with his soul.<br/>And Boris and Farage must be the Goliath. <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>            </p>                    </div>            </article></li><li class="user">    <article data-line-id="global" data-comment-id="576bf2cc2bd5d206f813d7e4" data-comment-reply="true" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Comment">        <div>                        <ul class="comment-interaction">                                            </ul>                        <h2><span class="commented">Comment</span>                <a href="#" class="commented inlinecomment">Commented</a>                <a href="/profile/564c3d31bc1f571dc0a8b363" itemprop="author">Steve Hurst</a>                <time  itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2016-06-23T14:31Z">JUN 23, 2016</time>            </h2>            <p itemprop="text">                @John<br/><br/>I am sorry John but you are wrong.

I feel that the bottom two quintiles are being ignored, not only in the EU, but also in America and (less so) in Canada, and that&#39;s why the whole thing is beginning to turn against The Establishment order, which will facilitate the creation of even more terrifying groups than ISIS to flourish in the future, with millions of Western kids flocking to join. <br/><br/>The Hippies/1960&#39;s antiwar/civil rights movements and #OWS were simply manifestations of the bottom two quintiles not having a real opportunity to meet their (Maslow&#39;s) Hierarachy of Needs. And how costly to America was all of that? <br/><br/>Relatively minor policy changes could have prevented ALL of it -- at least, if applied at the beginning of each of those movements. <br/><br/>Richard Nixon&#39;s foresighted support of a Guaranteed Basic Income to replace welfare, and other similar programmes would have addressed at least half, but maybe as much as 90% of the problems that later occurred. <br/><br/>Imagine an America that had never experienced... inner city problems/gang violence/drug trade/violent protest movements/non-state actors and organizations, etc. But that&#39;s a discussion for a different day...<br/><br/>Which is why democracy, democratic votes, and referendums are so CATHARTIC.<br/><br/>Due to PM David Cameron&#39;s brilliant idea to turn it into a democratic debate instead of just bulldozing over the will of the people -- thereby setting the stage for another version of &#39;the troubles&#39; to occur (but this time in England) Britain has defaulted to their highest values instead of the rule of the jungle. And I am exceptionally proud of David Cameron, his government, and Britain on account of that decision.<br/><br/>Giving &#39;The People&#39; a way to voice their opinion via referenda is a lot of work, and yes, democracy can be messy -- but it always beats civil unrest and violence in the streets.<br/><br/>Simply stated, if the EU had listened to and addressed the concerns of the bottom two economic quintiles in Britain, there wouldn&#39;t have ever been a need for a referendum, nor would (likely) more than 50% of voters feel the need to exit a bad marriage.<br/><br/>If Britain votes to leave the EU tomorrow, I place 100% of the blame for that decision on the EU governance architecture for not helping Britons make yearly progress towards their Hierarchy of Needs goals -- and I salute David Cameron for having the proper vision and the strong leadership to turn it into a democratic debate, instead of another decades-long streetfight akin to &#39;The Troubles&#39; in Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>The EU is finding it&#39;s way and I admire their steps forward; Even their missteps will prove to be valuable if they heed the message.<br/><br/>Let us hope they now spend more effort to ensure that all economic quintiles have the ability to reach their Hierarchy of Needs goals, instead of only the top two (or arguably, the top three) quintiles.<br/><br/>&#39;You gave me the opportunity to:<br/><br/>(1) meet my needs,<br/>OR; <br/>(2) not meet my needs&#39; <br/><br/>...will be the message from British voters tomorrow.<br/><br/>Deliberately or neglectfully &#39;painting people into a corner&#39; and implying that they should just quietly accept it -- means we can&#39;t label people &#39;isolationist&#39; in the pejorative sense-- it means we&#39;ve failed them.<br/><br/>And that is the magic of democracy. When citizens feel that their leaders have failed them, they can simply vote them out of office -- thereby negating the need for bloody coups, fifth columnists, secret organizations, or widespread civil protest movements -- in an attempt to meet their Hierarchy of Needs goals. <br/><br/>Unelected EU mandarins can&#39;t be &#39;fired&#39; by the people -- and therein lies the whole problem. Now it&#39;s brought us to June 23rd.<br/><br/>I appreciate the opportunity to read your thoughful and thought-provoking comments, jagjeet.

If EU leaders were unwilling to reform it in the face of the real risk of British independence, there is no way they will be willing to reform it once that rebellion has been crushed.<br/><br/>It may take the politically naive a little time to understand what is going one here, but the lesson that will start sinking in from Friday is this:  &quot;If coordinated Elite threats of retribution can bring even the famously independent Britishers to heel, then there is no limit to the power which the EU can exert over rebellious member states.  No-one else is anywhere near big enough or determined enough to take on this new &#39;imperial&#39; power.&quot;<br/><br/>The real context of a Brexit failure sees it paired with the collapse of the Populist uprising in the United States. Together these will mark 2016 as the greatest triumph for Elite power since the process of &quot;refeudalisation&quot; began in the 1970s.<br/><br/>In the United States the Sanders rebellion has already been crushed by the Democrat Party.  If - as now seems likely - the Trump rebellion fails in November, then the lesson which the Republican Establishment will learn is simple:  never again will the rank-and-file members of the Party be allowed to choose a nominee.  As night follows day, the outcome of this year&#39;s election is that the Republicans will adopt the Democrat&#39;s system of &quot;super-delegates&quot; to ensure that the party&#39;s Establishment has - at the very least - a veto over candidates.<br/><br/>This entrenchment of Elite power may be seen in the broader context of &quot;refeudalisation&quot;, a predictable response to the post-industrial era.<br/><br/>Stripped of its ephemera, human history up until the industrial era was a story of aggressively narcissistic, machiavellian psychopaths competing (sometimes collaborating) to attain positions of power, then using that power to dominate and brutalise their fellow human beings.  We know from the historical record that such psychopaths felt no empathy for &quot;their&quot; Subjects and no remorse in wasting the lives of thousands - even millions - of them.<br/><br/>If that behaviour seemed to moderate in the Modern Era, it was not because homo sapiens psychology had evolved.  Evolution - including evolutionary psychology - operates over a much longer time frame.<br/><br/>All that happened in the Modern Era was a temporary change in the environment.  It was just that the demands of the industrial economy made it expedient – for a time – for the Rulers to make certain concessions to their Subjects.<br/><br/>The industrial state required the training of large numbers of Subjects to operate the complex – but not fully automated – machinery of industrial production. Having had so much invested in them, Subjects had value and their bargaining power relative to their Rulers improved. In the extreme, they could withdraw their labour and quickly impose greater costs on the owners of capital than they themselves suffered. Under such conditions, the optimal strategy for Rulers (only after they had tried violent suppression and found it ineffective!) was to make certain limited concession to their Subjects.<br/><br/>Thus we had the quintessential ideals of the 20th century:<br/><br/>a) egalitarianism, the ideal that all people are entitled to the same basic opportunities irrespective of their ancestry;<br/><br/>b) democratisation, the ideal that Subjects are entitled to have some say in how they are governed; and<br/><br/>c) self-determination, the ideal that self-identifying communities are allowed to choose for themselves how they will govern themselves.<br/><br/>But these concessions didn’t mean that the psychopaths had gone away. The snakes have been there all the time. And there was never anything to say that the conditions of industrial production must last forever.<br/><br/>What we are witnessing now is simply the Elite’s response to the POST-industrial world, the world of AI and robotics. <br/><br/>No longer are large numbers of Subjects required to run complex – but not fully automated – machinery. Now it is small numbers of very highly trained technicians required to manage the robotic workforce. Small in number, they can easily be bought off. The IT technicians are the Praetorian Guard of the new regime.<br/><br/>As for the rest of humanity, they are now redundant, or soon will be. Their Rulers no longer need them. The concessions made previously are “inoperative”.<br/><br/>To be sure, they may get employment of a kind, especially in providing personal services.  But it will be employment in the &quot;Uber Economy&quot; of savage competition between workers with all economic rent flowing to the owners of the market platforms.<br/><br/>And the Elite are responding precisely as one would expect a self-serving Elite to respond. They are relentlessly winding back any concessions hitherto made, while their economic theologians are busy trying to justify it as being for the “Greater Good”.<br/><br/>Inequality is quickly returning to its historical norm, as Piketty has documented. We are returning to a feudal state in which property is owned by the magnates and everyone else is a defenceless serf.  <br/><br/>Even the critical technicians are transformed into obedient indentured workers through the weapon of crippling student debt.  If ever they are to get out from under, they must do as they&#39;re told.<br/><br/>As for democratisation, in most countries it never developed beyond &quot;elective&quot; government dominated by Elite parties.  Moneyed interests and well-organised pressure groups have found it a trivial exercise to subvert it. <br/><br/>And to entrench their gains, they are taking ever more critical decisions out of the hands even of elective government: the privatisation of strategic monopolies and essential services means that elected politicians are forced negotiate with private magnates, on terms dictated by the private magnates.  The alienation of taxes to private tax farms (such as road tolling monopolies) is a throwback to the Ferme Generale of the ancien regime.<br/><br/>And finally, self-determination has been eroded by the growth of opaque and unaccountable supranational organisations (like the EU) and so-called “trade” agreements (which actually have little to do with trade and everything to do with taking decisions out of the hands of national governments and giving them to unelected and unaccountable panels of the Elite).<br/><br/>With the Elite triumph of 2016, this is only going to get worse. <br/><br/>At some point, the Elite may even decide that the continued existence of masses of redundant human beings is a threat to their own security.<br/><br/>Already, we have seen the recent unveiling of weaponised robotic “security guards” with rudimentary AI. That technology isn’t going to go away.<br/><br/>You don’t need to be Einstein to see how this game will play itself out. The most plausible scenarios do not support a happy ending for the majority of human beings.<br/><br/>The Populists uprisings of Brexit in Europe and Sanders/Trump in the United States are nothing more than The People engaging in a desperate last stand to forestall the horror that is descending upon them. It is a game that must be fought on a battlefield chosen by the Elite themselves.<br/><br/>Realistically, the chances of success are remote.  Realistically, the future is grim.<br/><br/>There is – perhaps – still a tiny window of opportunity to forestall this holocaust, but it is closing rapidly. As the Elite re-consolidate their power it will become ever more difficult for the Subjects to do anything about it.<br/><br/>The only tiny glimmer of hope for most of the human race is that they can somehow fight to introduce Democracy: true Democracy wherein the People exercise actual control over their Rulers, institutional changes which will make politicians truly accountable to the People.<br/><br/>But as things stand now, the chances of averting this holocaust are very, very remote.<br/> <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>            </p>                    </div>            </article></li><li class="user">    <article data-line-id="global" data-comment-id="57698fc02bd5d206f8563640" data-comment-reply="false" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Comment">        <div>                        <ul class="comment-interaction">                                <li><a href="#" class="reply">Reply</a></li>                                            </ul>                        <h2><span class="commented">Comment</span>                <a href="#" class="commented inlinecomment">Commented</a>                <a href="/profile/54cccafb4a42310d3ca742de" itemprop="author">Peter Schneider</a>                <time  itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2016-06-21T19:04Z">JUN 21, 2016</time>            </h2>            <p itemprop="text">                Restore a sense of control and responsibility to the electorates?

And it is exactly the same, despite the GB and GR are not of the same mercantile and economic past and future potential! Let alone the global language, judicial system, financial institutions etc..<br/>Anyways, what they really convey through the &quot;economic argument&quot; is political in its gist. Its strange to me as a foreigner how the rich and deep english democratic culture can bear the truly elitist and undemocratic nomenclature of Brussels. This is essentially the question of the referendum.<br/>Greeks, despite the extraordinary brainwashing of fear mixed with economic-astrologic predictions, voted AGAINST the model of hegemonic financial help, which financial nomenclature would like to see everywhere in Europe. <br/>It would be a shame for GB not to take the same option and, thus, reinvigorate the european project.<br/>I hope you vote pro Europe and not pro EU. <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>            </p>                    </div>            </article></li><li class="user">    <article data-line-id="global" data-comment-id="5768a8af2bd5d206f8f09cef" data-comment-reply="false" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Comment">        <div>                        <ul class="comment-interaction">                                <li><a href="#" class="reply">Reply</a></li>                                            </ul>                        <h2><span class="commented">Comment</span>                <a href="#" class="commented inlinecomment">Commented</a>                <a href="/profile/d2d7010246f86fd027f92d73" itemprop="author">John Brian Shannon</a>                <time  itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2016-06-21T02:38Z">JUN 21, 2016</time>            </h2>            <p itemprop="text">                Hi Michael,<br/><br/>Every day, we teach others how to treat us.<br/><br/>At a personal level, how we interact with others shows them how to treat us.<br/><br/>As human nature is the foundation of all human relationships; Even the political relationship between nation-states are directed by human beings -- not artificial intelligence bots.<br/><br/>Therefore, if we make people feel afraid, they will act defensively toward us.

In the face of  &quot;the  political and social fragmentation extending well beyond Europe,&quot; Spence points out three fundamental issues which have been the causes of political paralysis, economic malaise and popular discontent in the developped world, that need to be  addressed urgently.  <br/>First, politicians have failed to deal with wealth gap  and  unequal distribution of income and resources.  Spence says, &quot;the costs and benefits of forced structural change,&quot; following globalisation and technology, as well as  &quot;growth patterns in most of the developed world have been problematic for the past 20 years.&quot; While politicians in the developped world  have been slow to respond to the changes triggered by technology and macroeconomic conditions, multinationals have outsourced their manufacturing to low-cost countries, creating unemployment among the working class. The developping world benefits from globalisation and free trade, giving rise to a middle class.  <br/>Second, the &quot;ongoing crisis&quot; proves to be chronic, and  &quot;has kept growth far too low and unemployment – especially youth unemployment – unacceptably high.&quot;  We also see a job paradox - labour shortage amid high unemployment. There are often not enough people to take  high-end jobs in certain industries, while high income earners create an &quot;income polarization,&quot; - putting &quot;sustained pressure on the middle class.&quot; In many EU countries,  governments have failed to provide for vocational training programme to improve the skills of their working populations that match job requirements and global challenges. Spence points out the &quot;disentchantment&quot; in the US  &quot;at growth patterns and policies that seem to benefit those at the top disproportionately.&quot; But on the whole popular anger is wide spread in the absence of &quot;effective responses&quot; and a &quot;concerted effort – based on genuine burden sharing – to address these issues.&quot; Spence is highly critical of  the powers bestowed upon central banks, and their handling of the global financial crisis and the crisis in the Eurozone. <br/>Third, the EU, &quot;like much of the developed world&quot; is strugling with &quot;powerful forces&quot; such as fringe parties on the left and right. They operate  &quot;beyond the control of elected officials,&quot;  &quot;shaping citizens’ lives,&quot; and leaving mainstream politicians feeling &quot;powerless.&quot; Working class people see globalisation and technology as causes of their grievances, and populist leaders lambaste the EU, being &quot;beyond the reach of democratic institutions,&quot; that ordinary people can relate to. As &quot;local governance&quot; is not always &quot;problem-free&quot; EU-opponents don&#39;t know which they abhor more. What Spence fears is another crisis in the eurozone, as its situation is &quot;particularly unstable.&quot; <br/>On the whole Spence sees governance and not economics as the trigger of  many Britons&#39; desire to leave the EU. The notion of &quot;effective and inclusive self-governance&quot; may resonate with the &quot;Leavers,&quot; but technology does not &quot;respect national boundaries.&quot;  Indeed, there are still Britons who want to remain, and &quot;are prepared to take another shot at reforming the bloc&#39;s  governance structures.&quot; Despite its flaws and imperfections, many believe &quot;the world would be a far better place with a united, democratic Europe as a major force for both stability and change.&quot; Spence hopes that a &quot;remain&quot; vote, &quot;along with similar strong centrifugal political trends elsewhere, should bring about a major rethink of European governance structures and institutional arrangements,&quot; which would aim &quot;to restore a sense of control and responsibility to the electorates.&quot; In the long run Europe will benefit from reforms. But it would &quot;require inspired leadership from all corners of Europe – including government, business, organized labor, and civil society as well as a renewed commitment to integrity, inclusiveness, responsibility, and generosity.&quot; If Britain votes to remain, no major political reforms are expected until after the national elections in France and Germany in 2017.  <a class="read-more" href="#">Read more</a>            </p>                    </div>            </article></li><li class="user">    <article data-line-id="global" data-comment-id="576818dc2bd5d206f85ddcfb" data-comment-reply="false" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Comment">        <div>                        <ul class="comment-interaction">                                <li><a href="#" class="reply">Reply</a></li>                                            </ul>                        <h2><span class="commented">Comment</span>                <a href="#" class="commented inlinecomment">Commented</a>                <a href="/profile/549ed1754a423108e4007a0f" itemprop="author">Vanishing Leprechaun</a>                <time  itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2016-06-20T16:25Z">JUN 20, 2016</time>            </h2>            <p itemprop="text">                “...particularly those related to automation ...”. This is only a common place: automation in industry started in 1973, and its spreading up all around the automotive industry started in 1978 (Fiat Comau, The RoboGate, Rivalta and Fiat Ritmo): 38 years ago. It is questionable how much automation affected employment, but in any case this story is over, completely outdated.  The same can be said about the “digital”: computers spread in enterprises started in the immediate aftermath of WWII and this process reached its mature state during the &#39;90, 20 years ago.<br/>Don&#39;t try to spread the current lie that our troubles depends on automation and computerization, it is ridiculous. <br/>The beginning of the decline of wage share in US is around the &#39;70, thus it cannot depend on more recent factors.<br/>“After all, democracy is a system for experimentation, as well for the expression of citizens’ will.” All right, but this is exactly what doesn&#39;t happen - because it can&#39;t. At least in UE, where policies are written once in a time into the treaties (and sometimes, recently, into Constitutions), and in every country we assist from decades to the phenomenon of oligarchic capture. After all, democracy is a system in which citizens can experiment different alternative, not merely alternation amid parties who differ only on cosmetic details. But this is exactly what is happening in EU and I suspect this process is starting also in US.  And this is the reason of the increasing abstention from election, almost everywhere.<br/>Brexit nor Bremain have nothing to do with “being European”. Europe is a continent, no country can move from it (at least at the present state of technology. Big Data too can&#39;t move countries). They have to do instead with European Union, THIS EU. Exiting from EU doesn&#39;t mean “exiting from Europe” (which lacks of any sense), nor from the European “free trade area”. EU isn&#39;t Europe nor a free trade area.
