No no no no aniyo!!!!

Kill YiSeul, kill her not Back Ho. Why?!?!?!!

I can’t, I just can’t anymore. Why are y’all doin this to me.

Ok I’m done, done with this drama. I can’t take it anymore.

Now that I’m done with my ten year old tantrum.
I still don’t like YS she is still aggreviatin me to the tenth power. Mr. Perfect, please go somewhere like another country and take YS with you please.

Oh Back Ho, oh Back Ho. I see you finally got that backbone and man upped but for all the wrong reasons. I just can’t support you on your quest to be with YS anymore, I like you too much to see you waste your life on her.

Conductor Dad: you shouldve said no to Back Ho and took him away or something.

I’m glad that there is only one more episode left cuz I’m so ready to find all the writers of this show and force them to go jump off a cliff, a very high cliff together.

Here’s to wishful thinking that Back Ho ends up with someone else.

I don’t like that he chose Yi Seul over his dad. He always chooses her over everyone else including himself. And now he’s going to literally sacrifice his life for her. Meanwhile she won’t even give up “stable” Jin Won for him. Frankly the things she does for him, like helping him with his career and going to find his dad, don’t really impress me at all. They don’t make her endearing or loveable because Baek Ho doesn’t want or ask for any of those things from her. He only ask her to be with him, the man she loves, but no. She won’t do it. So frustrating. And it doesn’t even make sense. Why can’t she just leave her secret plans of making him happy and just marry him and actually make him happy?! Gah!
